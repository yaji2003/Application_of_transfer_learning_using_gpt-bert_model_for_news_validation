19796,"Marco Rubio: President Trump Will Empower the People of Cuba, Not Communist Leaders - Breitbart",Charlie Spiering,"Florida Senator Marco Rubio praised Donald Trump for empowering the Cuban people by reversing some of0 former President Barack Obama‚Äôs diplomatic concessions with the Castro brothers. [‚ÄúMore than anything else this change empowers the people of Cuba   ‚Ä¶     America is prepared to outstretch its hand and work with the people of Cuba, but we will not empower their oppressors,‚Äù Rubio said during an event in Florida to highlight Trump‚Äôs policy changes with Cuba.

Germans living in Britain have been cautioned against speaking their native language in public places after the Brexit vote set hate crimes soaring. 
Speaking to the German newspaper Die Welt, lawyer Carmen Prem thought it was best to not speak ‚Äútoo loudly‚Äù when out and about.

‚ÄúThe tone has changed,‚Äù said the mother-of-two who has been living in London for 13 years. ‚ÄúNo Briton would ever say ‚Äòwe do not want you here.‚Äô But it is now ‚Äòwe and you.‚Äô‚Äù 
She also recounted how on the bus home she had recently heard the driver tell passengers to ‚Äúkindly speak English.‚Äù 
In the piece, other Germans tell of ‚Äústronger xenophobia‚Äù in the country since the referendum in June. 
There is a ‚Äúnew bitterness, an anger which hardly any of the countless non-British on the island expected,‚Äù it adds. 
Race and religious crimes saw a 41 percent rise in the month after the Brexit vote. Nearly 5,500 incidents were recorded by the Home Office in July alone. 
The overall hate crime rate was also up 19 percent on last year. Four out of five of the crimes reported were motivated by race hatred, seven percent by religion. 
King‚Äôs College London professor Mischa Dohler told Die Welt he was now considering moving abroad. 
The German academic claimed he had been offered several jobs, including an opportunity at Cambridge, but had to turn them down as he does not know what will follow the Brexit negotiations. 
‚ÄúMany non-British academics simply see no future here,‚Äù he said. Abuse & insecurities 
Worries among German citizens come after a Spanish man was knocked down by a passerby with a wooden plank in Bournemouth earlier this month. 
The man was reportedly speaking to his girlfriend in his native language when the thug approached him shouting ‚Äúf***ing Spanish, speak in English‚Äù before hitting him with a piece of wood grabbed from a nearby building.

19798,Thieves Steal Bees that Pollinate Central Valley Almonds,Chriss W. Street,"Hundreds of bee hives worth over a half million dollar0s shipped to California‚Äôs Central Valley for the annual almond tree pollination were stolen on January 17, the Los Angeles Times reports. [Montana beekeeper Lloyd Cunniff, owner of Beeline Honey Co. shipped 488 bee hives to Sutter County in   to service his almond grower pollination contracts. But after tending his bees in a grove near Meridian on Monday, he returned Tuesday morning to find his $542, 000 of hives missing.  Bee pollination is not only important to rural agricultural communities throughout the Central Valley it also provides a global economic benefit of about $290 billion in 2015. There are an estimated 115, 000  ‚Äî   125, 000 beekeepers in the United States. Although the vast majority of beekeepers are hobbyists with fewer than 25 hives, there are a few thousand commercial operators with 300 or more beehives. The 2. 6 million domestic honey bee colonies in the U. S. produced 149 million pounds of honey in 2013. With a wholesale price of about $2. 12 a pound, the crop was worth about $317 million. California was the fifth largest American producer with 10. 9 million pounds, worth $22. 9 million, according to the National Honey Board. Because millions of acres of U. S. fruit, nut, vegetable, oilseed and legume seed crops worth about $19 billion depend on bees, commercial operators are paid by growers to migrate their colonies each year to provide pollination services. But with demand drastically outstripping California‚Äôs local supply, Beeline travels 900 miles from Choteau, Montana each year to service contracts around the Sacramento area. According to government U. S. agricultural data, the cost of renting honey bee hives for almond pollination has vaulted for about $50 per hive in 2003, to $ $200 per hive today. It now takes more than a million bee colonies to service California‚Äôs annual crop. After 500 hives were stolen last year, the California State Beekeepers Assn. issued an advisory to beekeepers across the state to beware of an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù rise in beehive thefts.",0
19799,"‚ÄòGaps of Trust‚Äô With Russia Bar a Syrian Truce, Obama Says - The New York Times",Mark Landler,"VIENTIANE, Laos  ‚Äî   The Obama administration‚Äôs latest effort to broker a   in Syria‚Ä0ôs civil war fell short on Monday, after a   meeting between President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia failed to resolve problems between them. ‚ÄúGiven the gaps of trust that exist, that‚Äôs a tough negotiation, and we haven‚Äôt yet closed the gaps in a way where we think it would actually work,‚Äù Mr. Obama declared at a news conference at the end of a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China. He did not describe the points of contention. Other officials have said they involve technical issues like how to staff checkpoints in combat areas. But the checkered history of Syrian    ‚Äî   the United States agreed to one with Russia in February, only to watch it unravel weeks later  ‚Äî   has left the president deeply leery. On a day of diplomacy and history, Mr. Obama later flew to Laos, becoming the first sitting American president to visit this country, where children still stumble over unexploded bombs dropped by the United States during the Vietnam War. Having failed to halt the guns in Syria, Mr. Obama will seek reconciliation with the victims of a war long over. He insisted he was not giving up on Syria, however. Mr. Obama said he had instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to continue negotiating with the Russians this week to see if a deal on Syria was possible. The goals would be to halt the rain of bombs on Aleppo and to give breathing space to a United   effort to find a political end to Syria‚Äôs war between the forces of President Bashar   which are backed by Russia, and an array of insurgents seeking to depose him. ‚ÄúThe faster we can offer some relief to folks on ground,‚Äù Mr. Obama said, ‚Äúthe better off we‚Äôre going to be. ‚Äù At his own news conference in Hangzhou, Mr. Putin said the Syria talks were on the ‚Äúright track,‚Äù though he declined to discuss details of a deal. He expressed hope that an agreement could be reached ‚Äúin the next few days,‚Äù despite earlier disagreements. ‚ÄúThen we can say that our joint work with the United States in the fight against terrorist organizations, including along the Syrian track, will be significantly improved and intensified,‚Äù Mr. Putin said. Mr. Obama‚Äôs appearance was his last at the Group of 20, a gathering of industrialized nations that is supposed to focus on economic issues but often finds those matters eclipsed by war and terrorism. He reminisced about his first meeting, in 2009, when the world was still reeling from the financial crisis. This time, the meeting dramatized both his   status and the changed world that his successor will inherit. On Sunday, during a photograph session with the other leaders, Mr. Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey huddled with each other. A curious Mr. Obama peered at them from the other side of the room. Tensions between Russia and Turkey have escalated over Syria, but the two countries‚Äô leaders have begun talking more in recent weeks, just as Turkey‚Äôs ties with the United States have frayed. Mr. Obama had a rough welcome in Hangzhou on Saturday, when a dispute over the stairs he would use to exit Air Force One left him disembarking from a door in the belly of the plane. Some China experts interpreted it as a snub of a departing leader by a rising power. On his departure, however, the Chinese arranged for a shiny set of stairs with a strip of blue lights beneath the railing to be rolled up to the plane. Mr. Obama remains a central figure in conversations on a variety of issues, including Iran and international economics. But there was a palpable sense on his Asia trip that the world was awaiting a new president to reassess American policies in Syria, Ukraine and North Korea. On Syria, Mr. Obama left the diplomatic heavy lifting to Mr. Kerry, who met twice in Hangzhou with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. On Sunday, the Americans were confident enough of success that they scheduled a briefing to announce a   agreement, erecting two lecterns for the secretary of state and foreign minister. Soon afterward, State Department officials hastily removed one, and Mr. Kerry turned up alone to report that the United States and Russia had been unable to move past a handful of ‚Äútough issues. ‚Äù The talks continued, though, with the Russians appearing more eager than the Americans to elevate them to the presidential level. Mr. Obama has been openly skeptical of the likelihood of a durable deal involving the Russians. After the meeting with Mr. Putin, it was clear his suspicions had not been dispelled. He recalled the failure of the previous deal that the United States had made with Russia. ‚ÄúSlowly, it unwound, and we‚Äôre back into a situation in which Assad‚Äôs regime is bombing with impunity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is a very dangerous dynamic. ‚Äù As he often does, Mr. Obama characterized his exchange with Mr. Putin as blunt and businesslike. There was no shortage of thorny subjects. The president said they had discussed computer security, though he declined to say whether he had brought up allegations that Russia breached the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had trouble with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving into a new era. ‚Äù Mr. Obama is also hoping to turn the page in Laos. The ostensible reason for the visit is two regional conferences that will give him a chance to promote his strategy of pivoting to Asia: the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the East Asia Summit. But Laos has other resonance for Mr. Obama, who has made a vocation, from Cuba to Myanmar, of opening ties to closed societies. The United States and Laos have a difficult relationship that dates to the C. I. A. ‚Äôs undeclared war in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, when American warplanes dropped 270 million bombs on this country, many of which are still buried in fields and forests. Mr. Obama, administration officials said, would pledge millions of dollars in additional funding to help clear unexploded ordnance from the Laotian countryside. ‚ÄúSince Laos is still a relatively poor country that is developing, their capacity alone to clean that up is hampered by lack of resources,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe should help. ‚Äù First, though, the president canceled a meeting scheduled for Tuesday with the leader of the Philippines, an American ally in Southeast Asia. Earlier in the day, the new Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, delivered a   diatribe against Mr. Obama, calling him, among other things, a ‚Äúson of a bitch. ‚Äù Mr. Duterte threatened to do so again face to face if the president challenged his inflammatory words or his unorthodox tactics in his country‚Äôs drug war. Mr. Obama has yet to meet Mr. Duterte, and the timing would have been important: The Philippines is in the midst of a dangerous    with China over disputed islands in the South China Sea. Still, Mr. Obama questioned the wisdom of putting Mr. Duterte and himself in a room together. ‚ÄúI always want to make sure if I‚Äôm having a meeting that it‚Äôs actually productive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúClearly, he‚Äôs a colorful guy,‚Äù Mr. Obama added.",0
19800,"Clinton, FBIGate and the true depth of the ObamaGeddon",nan,"Clinton, FBIGate and the true depth of the ObamaGeddon 1 31.10.2016 Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a problem. Just over one week before the Mother of All Elections, we have information which shocks us to the core, freezes our hearts and sends chills shuddering through our spines. Ladies and Gentlemen, the problem is not FBIGate, it is the mechanisms behind the scenes which have not been reported. Read on. First off, how many times has President Obama blocked investigation into Hillary Clinton's affairs? You will never know. You will never, ever know because the system is rigged, there is no paper trail. There are telephone calls, there are meetings behind closed doors, there are threats. This time however, Obama was caught by surprise. The Nobel Peace Prizewinner, the one who insulted the Nobel Institution, the international community and all those who believed in his shitfaced lie ""Change"", the one who blasted Libya from the African country with the highest human development index back to the stone age, riddled with terrorists, including Islamic State, the one who stood back as Islamic State appeared under his nose... this one this time was unable to stop an FBI investigation because it happened behind his back. Trying to get at the truth Print version Font Size Ladies and Gentlemen, this truth will not come out in the next few days. For those with their political knives a-glistening and a-gleaming behind Hillary's back, waiting for some knock-out soundbites from those documents, it is not going to happen. Not because the FBI investigation failed to unveil juicy stuff, but because that juicy stuff will never reach the public domain. ObamaGeddon to the rescue, FBIGate quashed. And while FBIGate is quashed, watch what happens behind the scenes with the electoral system. George Soros is firmly in the Clinton camp, so they say. Does anyone know how many States use electronic voting systems run by George Soros? Does anyone know how easy it is to hack or rig these voting machines? These machines churn out votes. There is no accountability, there is no paper trail, the vote will not be verified. There will be numbers, statistics the day after, rigged. This is American democracy? The collective answer is no, the collective response is we all know this is true, we all know this is happening. Nobody likes Hillary, nobody trusts Hillary. So why vote for her? Investigating FBIGate Now let's see what my friend Nancy O'Brien Simpson turned up. She lives in the United States of America, she is a political commentator and she is a political activist: Secretary Clinton fell for the oldest hack in the book. This hack entails something called the ""Buffer Overflow Exploit"" that involves ""stacking"" a malicious computer virus in an area on your hard drive where virus protection software can't find them. Then it steals the files from the hard drive. A friend of mine who has been on the wrong side of these kinds of situations explained what he has read about how it all went down- Huma and Anthony are sharing a laptop at their home. Huma receives classified information from her boss, Hillary Clinton, in various e-mails and texts. She testified to the F.B.I. that she often emailed classified files over her unsecured Yahoo account in order to print them out at home on the laptop she shared with her husband Antony. When Huma goes to bed, Carlos Danger sneaks out in his pajammies and prowls 4chan all night looking for young teen girls to send them naked photos. One of these photos contains a computer virus that infects the laptop. This virus hides in photographs stored on a computer's hard drive by exploiting a photo's bandwidth. When the recipient receives photos in return, the photos contain information from the computer it has infested. The ironic part is every time Carlos Danger send photos of his ""wiener"" his nasty photos contained ALL the emails his wife received from Hillary as well as the classified documents she printed out.. This means some hackers out there on the net has EVERYTHING Huma brought home.. If the hackers are ""White Hat"" they probably told the F.B.I. to examine every one of Carlos Danger's nasty photos he sent over that laptop. If the hackers are ""Black Hats"" you can bet some foreign government has a lot of classified documents. The Clinton Crime Family will blame the Russians, which is laughable and serious at the same time.. You know they reopened the investigation BEHIND Obama's back because he has blocked the investigation of her at every turn. I heard the rank and file FBI were about to mutiny because they know she is guilty as sin and Comey would not prosecute because she is protected by Obama AND Clinton gave his wife half a million for her political campaign. This might be big, but Obama will stop it to protect her and his globalist masters. I rest my case. Nancy O'Brien Simpson Ms. Simpson was a radio personality in New York. She was a staff writer for The Liberty Report. A PBS documentary was done on her activism for human rights. She is a psychotherapist and political commentator.",1

A new study finds the scariest part of the holiday may not be the costumes, but makeup for kids. Out of 48 makeup palettes, almost half contained toxic heavy metals. 
Nearly 20 percent of makeup palettes contain lead and cadmium, according to the newly published study by the Breast Cancer Fund. The study found that some products contained as many as four metals, including arsenic and chromium. Indiana housing complex to be razed after toxic lead levels detected https://t.co/qZy4gfTmnC pic.twitter.com/5bGsRti1Im ‚Äî RT America (@RT_America) August 31, 2016 
Nine of the palettes were found to contain lead, a chemical that is unsafe at any level, for children particularly. Parents may have purchased and applied these products to their children unwittingly, as the makeup doesn‚Äôt have to list ingredients on their labels. 
The BCF may have been among the first to test the palettes, as the FDA does not regulate this particular product. 
"" The FDA that regulates makeup does not have the power to require pre-market testing ,"" Jen Coleman with the Oregon Environmental Council told KGW. 
The cosmetic safety law enacted 75 years ago does not require testing even for products marketed to children. While the FDA cannot do anything about the problem, they have issued guidelines to avoiding ‚Äú a rash, swollen eyelids, or other reaction ‚Äù this Halloween. 
The guidelines make no mention of potential heavy metal poisoning, but they do offer advice like ‚Äú Follow all directions carefully ,‚Äù and ‚Äú Don't decorate your face with things that aren't intended for your skin. ‚Äù 
What‚Äôs a parent to do in the meantime? Other than use all-natural makeup, the best option is to avoid dark pigments. The BCF study found a correlation between the darkness of the color and the lead content. The darker the color, the more lead it was found to contain.",1

19805,Will There Be Riots In America The Day After Donald Trump Wins The Presidency?,Relampago Furioso,"The above photo was snapped in Ferguson as thugs burned the city down. Could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of 1it soon to a city near you?
The election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum. But few people are focused on the day after the election. No matter who wins this year‚Äôs presidential ‚Äúselection‚Äù the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility. Are you ready for chaos if it develops?
The nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems.
The ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if Trump wins. If Trump wins, get ready for Black Lives Matter, the Black Panthers, The Race (La Raza) and other racially motivated anti-white groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again. After all, they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in Ferguson, Baltimore, Charlotte, and San Jose . A worrisome precedent has been set.
Of course, Trump won‚Äôt be in power the day after election day (we have to wait until Inauguration Day for him to clean up any potential messes) so Barack Hussein Obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective Stradivarius, plays my heart bleeds for thee, and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation.
If The Bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped away
If Hillary wins, there‚Äôs the real possibility of protests the day after the election, and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as they‚Äôre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around. A Hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away. Then, we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell. There could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a long-established narrative that they‚Äôre all evil racists.
Few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and well-being. It‚Äôs time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the American supply chain is, and what could happen with only a short-term disruption in it.
Here‚Äôs a scenario ‚Äì just one of many possible scenarios. Video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractor-trailer in Charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop, America stops. If attacks on truckers happen often enough, truckers may decide it‚Äôs not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving. Within a day, bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razor‚Äôs edge in modern America and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out.
Supply Chain Rioters broke into trucks on I-85 and burned cargo in Charlotte
According to the American Trucking Association (ATA) a disruption of 24 to 48 hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food. Fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame. Garbage would start to pile up. Most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise. ATM and bank cash supplies would also run out.
The tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving.
As an example, the ATA tells us this is what happens during a hurricane. Imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities.
In a hurricane situation, supplies that would normally last a few days, such as water, powdered milk, and canned meat, typically disappear within one day. Given these inventory rates, this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and non-perishables in just a few days. Runs on food and non-food staples during hurricanes, and even before big winter storms, provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying. The same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason.
Panic buying means no food on the shelves. When people don‚Äôt have food at home and then the grocery store doesn‚Äôt have food, rioting will intensify. Things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect, after which Bedlam ensues.
So, it is best to be prepared with non-perishable items just in case things get out of hand. Have at least several weeks food supply on hand. But, how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash?
Be Armed The police won‚Äôt be around to protect you if Bedlam ensues
Contrary to gun propaganda from the media , you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath don‚Äôt pass peacefully. What happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas? Gangs form looking for homes that do have those items.
They‚Äôre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce.
A home with guns is a safe home. Just as this YouTube video shows , armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food, but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing.
Several handguns with extra ammunition are advised. Know how to use them. Be steady with the trigger. And don‚Äôt be afraid to use them if looters come to your house.
The police will NOT be there to protect you as they‚Äôll have their hands full with the chaos.
Better To Be Safe Than Sorry The idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory, but protecting your loved ones is still key
With the meltdown of America happening right before our very eyes, we are entering an unstable period in the nation‚Äôs history, to say the least. No matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away. Trump may be able to turn things around temporarily, but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all.
We are entering a period in which America will resemble a third world country more and more. The demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and Democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years . Divisions between rich and poor will grow, and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial, class, and gender division every step of the way . Peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance.
In this transition from prosperity to despotism, it is best to be safe than sorry. The day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years. It may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards Communism if The Bitch wins, or it may not be.
But my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years. Tend your own garden, as I know I will be tending my own. My military friends are already discussing what will happen in SHTF scenario. You should be thinking about it, too.

19806,"Trump Drops Truth Bombs on Cuba Regime, Policies - Breitbart",Joel B. Pollak,"President Donald Trump offered the most forthright criticism of Cuba since John F. Kennedy when he addressed a crowd in Miami ahead of signing an executive order reversing the Obama administration‚Äôs policy of normalization. [In a speech frequently interrupted by applause, and by cameo appearances from   activists, Trump laid out a moral case against the Castro regime and its policies that few previous presidents have dared to make.  ‚ÄúWe will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer,‚Äù Trump said. He laid out his principles and policies, including regime change: ‚ÄúWith God‚Äôs help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve,‚Äù he said, to sustained cheers and chants of ‚Äú  !‚Äù He listed some of the human rights abuses of the Castro regime, acknowledging those in the audience who had suffered the ‚Äútrue and brutal nature of the Castro regime   ‚Ä¶     many of you witnessed terrible crimes committed in service of a depraved ideology. ‚Äù He mentioned activists in Cuba who were prevented from leaving to attend his speech. He saluted exiles and dissidents present, some of whom had suffered decades of imprisonment in Cuba. Trump declared defiantly  ‚Äî   in a swipe at his predecessor: ‚ÄúNow that I am president, America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. Because we know it is best for America to have freedom in our hemisphere, whether in Cuba or Venezuela, and to have a future where the people of each country can live out their own dreams,‚Äù he said. He added: For nearly six decades, the Cuban people have suffered under communist domination. To this day, Cuba is ruled by the same people who killed tens of thousands of their own citizens, who sought to spread their repressive and failed ideology throughout our hemisphere, and who once tried to host enemy nuclear weapons ninety miles from our shores. The Castro regime has shipped arms to North Korea, and fueled chaos in Venezuela. While imprisoning innocents, it has harbored cop killers, hijackers, and terrorists. It has supported human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation all around the globe. This is the simple truth of the Castro regime. My administration will not hide from it, excuse it, or glamorize it. And we will never, ever be blind to it. We know what‚Äôs going on, and we remember what happened. And he declared: The previous administration‚Äôs easing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people. They only enrich the Cuban regime. The profits from investment and tourism flow directly to the [Cuban] military. The regime takes the money and owns the industry. The outcome of [the] last administration‚Äôs executive action has been only more repression, and a move to crush the peaceful, democratic movement. He later laid out conditions for a new agreement to improve relations, including dramatic improvements in Cuba‚Äôs human rights policies, the holding of free elections supervised by international observers, and the ‚Äúreturn of the cop killer, Joanne Chesimard. ‚Äù (The latter is known as ‚ÄúAssata Shakur‚Äù and is still lionized by the American left.) It was all too much for at least one Obama administration adviser. As Trump spoke, former Obama White House official Ben Rhodes, one of the main architects of normalization with Cuba, tweeted furiously in opposition. He declared: ‚ÄúTrump doesn‚Äôt care about the human rights of the Cuban people and his policies will do nothing to help them. ‚Äù Rhodes also challenged the   in the audience: ‚ÄúThe few people in Miami enabling Trump in carrying out this charade should be   held accountable. He could care less about Cubans,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tragic that some people in Fla are so determined to cling to a failed hardline on Cuba that they‚Äôre hitching themselves to Donald Trump,‚Äù he later added. Trump left the door open to diplomacy, stating that his new policy will maintain the U. S. embassy in Havana: ‚ÄúOur embassy [in Cuba] remains open in the hope that our countries can forge a stronger and much better path,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will respect Cuban sovereignty, but we will never turn our backs on the Cuban people,‚Äù he later added. Trump left no doubt that relations would henceforth have to be based on a foundation of truth  ‚Äî   not lenience toward a regime that secured   concessions from the Obama administration without any domestic political change.

19807,"USA Today Sports Writer Bashes Tom Brady, Praises Colin Kaepernick - Breitbart",Robert J. Marlow,"Nancy Armour, writing at USA Today, believes Tom Brady has a lot of explaining to do this Super Bowl week for his friendship with President Donald Trump. Moreover 1, in the same article, she praises Colin Kaepernick for being ‚Äúeloquent‚Äù in his criticism of law enforcement in America. [The San Francisco 49ers quarterback, who refused to stand for the Star Spangled Banner this season and wore socks with pigs dressed in police uniforms, is ‚Äúeloquent in detailing his concerns over police brutality in minority communities. He‚Äôs sparked conversations and reflection in NFL locker rooms and beyond,‚Äù states Armour. ‚ÄúKaepernick has been open, available and consistent with his opinion. ‚Äù   As she trashes the 45th president of the United States, Armour seems surprised when Kaepernick is ‚Äúportrayed as     and  . ‚Äù The writer empathizes with the beleaguered QB because after all, he denies those charges. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had insults, slurs and worse directed at him. He was blamed for the drop in TV ratings early in the season,‚Äù Armour laments. And to the author, perhaps the worst insult you could possibly levy on Kaepernick is that ‚ÄúOne person last week even tried to say Trump‚Äôs election was partly the result of Kaepernick‚Äôs protests. ‚Äù Of course, as far as Brady is concerned he deserves some tough questioning for his friendship with the president. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs campaign was steeped in racism, bigotry, and misogyny, and he has doubled down on his hatred in his first week as president. It‚Äôs left Americans across the country angry and frightened, fearful that the ideals that have made this country exceptional for more than 200 years are being abandoned,‚Äù Armour opines.  Brady describes his relationship with Trump as a long time friendship. He also had the audacity to have a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hat in his locker. For Armour that makes the Patriot‚Äôs star in support of racism and misogyny, that is unless he can unfriend Trump, Armour leads us to believe.  But, Brady said about the president that, ‚Äúif you know someone, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you agree with everything that they say or do. Right?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs things I don‚Äôt believe [in] absolutely. I don‚Äôt believe in, you know, there‚Äôs a lot of things,‚Äù Brady continued. ‚ÄúNot to denounce anything, it‚Äôs just that there are different things that I feel like, you know   ‚Ä¶     I don‚Äôt agree with everything. That‚Äôs fine, right?‚Äù Nope. That‚Äôs not good enough for Armour. Brady must be interrogated this week about Trump. And if he doesn‚Äôt know how to open himself to the media then all he needs to do is call on Colin. Because, ‚ÄúIf Brady needs an example of how that‚Äôs done, he can look at Kaepernick,‚Äù Armour informs us. ",0

Renaissance Jackson, the organization that briefly won the mayor‚Äôs office in predominantly Black Jackson, Mississippi, has launched a campaign to purchase a coding and programming capacity and a 3-D fabrication facility. They call it ‚ÄúFab Lab.‚Äù This technology, ‚Äúif it is democratically controlled, could actually serve humanity,‚Äù said Cooperation Jackson spokesman Kali Akuno . These kinds of projects are crucial, ‚Äúfirst and foremost, to satisfy some of the basic needs of our community, and -- on a deeper level -- to really put this means of production directly in our community‚Äôs hands.‚Äù High tech is ‚Äúone of these areas of the so-called ‚Äòdigital divide‚Äô that Black people have been sorely and strategically absent from,‚Äù said Akuno. ‚ÄúSo, we are doing it for ourselves.‚Äù Obamacare ‚ÄúImploding and Beyond Repair‚Äù 
The current wave of insurance rate hikes and medical service cutbacks is the predictable result of an Affordable Care Act (ACA) that ‚Äúwas pretty much a gift to the health insurance industry‚Äù when Congress passed it, in 2010, said Dr. John Geyman , professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle. ACA ‚Äúwas never designed for affordability -- it‚Äôs a misnomer in the name of the bill,‚Äù he said. Obamacare is ‚Äúimploding and beyond repair,‚Äù and unsustainable. ‚ÄúTweeks cannot work in the long term. The main fight should be for what will save money and give universal coverage to everyone: namely, single payer national health insurance.‚Äù Dr. Geyman said single payer healthcare could save $500 billion a year -- about the same as the entire U.S. ‚Äúdefense‚Äù budget. The Fight for Education for Liberation in Detroit 
At a ‚ÄúCommunity Conversation on the Crisis in the Schools,‚Äù Detroit activists, educators and parents gathered to address the question: ‚ÄúWho Created the School Crisis, and How are We Responding to it?‚Äù Among those wrestling with the issue was Dr. Thomas Pedroni , professor of Curriculum Studies at Wayne State University. He said the decline began with the state takeover of schools in the 1990s, and worsened dramatically after the imposition of state-appointed ‚Äúemergency managers.‚Äù ‚ÄúSchool could be one of the most meaningful places for our communities, but instead, it‚Äôs deadened,‚Äù Dr. Pedroni told the crowd at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. ‚ÄúBut, we‚Äôre going to fight to get back to the place where we have culturally relevant curriculum, not just producing a test score but to develop people who are self-empowered and who know how to fight for their community.‚Äù Venezuela Weathering Financial Storm, Despite Disinformation Campaign 
‚ÄúI challenge you to find one item of news that is positive to Venezuela in these last 16 or 17 years,‚Äù said Maria Paez Victor , a Venezuelan-born sociologist living in Toronto, Canada, and author of an article titled ‚ÄúHating Venezuela.‚Äù Ms. Victor said the United States and its rightwing allies in Venezuela have kept up a non-stop disinformation campaign ever since the late Hugo Chavez and his Socialist Party were democratically elected in 1998. A crisis triggered by the collapse of world oil prices allowed the opposition to capture the legislature, last year, but Victor says the government is coping. ‚ÄúVenezuela has managed to weather a terrible financial situation, but this is bad news for corporate capitalism and for the United States, because they want Venezuela to be controlled by their lackies.‚Äù Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey.

19809,Islamic State Targeting Spanish Coastal Resort Towns,Chris Tomlinson,"The Spanish government has released a new report claiming members of Islamic State c0ould be targeting coastal resort towns to carry out   massacres of tourists. [The coastal resort towns of Spain are popular with British, German, and other tourists across Europe and may be under threat according to the Spanish government. The government‚Äôs National Security report states Islamic State has increased its recruiting efforts in Spain and has started publishing more propaganda in Spanish leading to the increased warning over possible future attacks, De Telegraaf reports.  The report highlights several factors including cyber security and claim that the terror group will likely launch more cyber attacks in the near future that would target critical infrastructure in the country. In 2016, there were  21, 000 incidents of cyber attacks  ‚Äî   up 15 per cent from 2015. Of those around 3. 6 per cent were considered to be serious security threats. The terror group is also said to have launched a campaign last summer to procure more Spanish translators to help spread their jihadist propaganda on social media. The increase in Spanish propaganda ‚Äúimplies an increase of the risk of its influence on the radicals installed in our country,‚Äù the report notes. While no specific geographical targets have been named by the terror group, the report notes an attack would put the civil aviation sector at risk due to the possible effect on the global economy. Spain has maintained a high alert status across the entire country and is presently at threat level 4. This means authorities believe there is a potential attack risk, though no official or specific plans have been discovered. In 2016, the government carried out 36 police operations which led to the arrest of 69 people who are alleged to have connections to terrorist groups. Also mentioned was the increased migration of African migrants into Spain‚Äôs North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Over the past year, both areas have seen migrants break through or climb over the large border fences in an effort to claim asylum in the European Union (EU). In one instance earlier this year, over a thousand migrants stormed Ceuta in one day. Last month in the enclave, two people were arrested by police accused of having connections to Islamic State. The Interior Ministry did not give out the identities of those arrested but did note that many of the 180 arrests of individuals linked to the terror group over the last two years occurred in Ceuta.",0

19815,Trump Considering ‚ÄôExplosive‚Äô Executive Order on Unfair Trade,John Carney,"The Trump administration is working on an executive order that could be much broader than the   dumping measures reported earlier, according to Axio0s. [Last week, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order targeting Chinese dumping into the U. S. soon after the conclusion of China President Xi Jinping state visit in Florida. Under the Obama administration, a preliminary study by the Commerce Department found that China was dumping steel into the U. S. at below market prices.  Back in September, the U. S. International Trade Commission affirmed a decision to impose   and   duties on certain steel imports from Australia, Brazil, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea and Turkey. The Trump administration recently launched a   investigation into the massive and persistent trade deficits the U. S. runs with   ‚Äútrading partnets‚Äù and the unfair trading policies that may be causing them. Axios describes the potential for an executive order with broader trade sanctions as ‚Äúexplosive,‚Äù although it reports that while the plans are ‚Äúvery fluid‚Äù and there are internal disagreements about how aggressive the order will be, it likely won‚Äôt be confined to steel. Axios report Jonathan Swan says White House sources have told him: A White House official told Breitbart News that it is likely any executive order to emerge prior to the investigation into trade deficits is completed would be narrowly tailored to commodities and metals such as steel and aluminum and wouldn‚Äôt include broader manufactured goods such as appliances.",0
19816,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Struggle to Be Unifying Voice for Nation - The New York Times,Patrick Healy,"No moment in the 2016 presidential campaign has cried out more for a unifying candidate than the police shootings of two black men last week and the ensuing natio0nal uproar, followed by the shocking sniper ambush that killed five police officers in Dallas. And no other moment has revealed more starkly how hard it is for Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to become that candidate. Never have two presidential nominees been as unpopular as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and they are not fully trusted by their own parties nor showing significant crossover appeal in the polls. Mr. Trump, the   champion of law and order, is also the political figure many people blame for sowing division and hatred with his attacks on illegal immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans and others. Rather than defuse tension, he electrifies crowds and vanquishes rivals through provocations that he delights in calling politically incorrect. Of the two, Mrs. Clinton would seem more able, and driven, to try to bring the country together. She has a large following among black voters and speaks ardently about the need for ‚Äúrespect‚Äù and ‚Äúlove and kindness. ‚Äù After Dallas, she called on ‚Äúwhite people to understand how   feel every day. ‚Äù Yet many on the right and some on the left dislike her intensely, and even her admirers say she lacks the public emotion, oratorical skills and reputation for honesty to persuade large numbers of Americans to see things her way. The need for a reassuring and healing voice has come at a particularly bad time for the two presumptive presidential nominees. For many Americans, Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs credibility was further damaged last week as the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, sharply criticized her for being ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù about her use of private email as secretary of state. At the same time, Mr. Trump alienated many voters with his mixed comments about Saddam Hussein and his defensiveness over a Twitter post that many people regarded as  . ‚ÄúTrump is 100 percent saying the right things about police and respecting authority, but then he says these other comments that are too weird for voters to ignore,‚Äù said Fred L. DeLuca, a Trump supporter and former police officer who owns a graphic supply store in Youngstown, Ohio. ‚ÄúAnd Hillary  ‚Äî   I don‚Äôt trust what she says about law enforcement, not at all. ‚Äù Traumatic events have at times become opportunities for presidential candidates to step up and grow in the eyes of the American public, such as when Bill Clinton went to Los Angeles in 1992 in the aftermath of the riots there, or when Barack Obama pushed for aggressive, bipartisan action from the federal government to stem the banking crisis and protect taxpayers. Mr. Clinton‚Äôs   image and empathic personality appealed across party lines, as did Mr. Obama‚Äôs historic candidacy. And in moments of national crisis, presidents have shown ability to unify the country, if fleetingly, like George W. Bush did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. These candidates did not have to sell themselves to voters against such an intense combination of terrorism, mass shootings, police and gun violence, social unease and   fear. Still, the current run of crises has, in the view of many Democrats and Republicans, served only to spotlight the shortcomings of both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. ‚ÄúThe sense of alienation and estrangement is so great today that it‚Äôs hard to unite people, and these candidates haven‚Äôt done it,‚Äù said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Clinton backer. The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared the current political climate to the Civil War era and recalled Lincoln‚Äôs ‚ÄúHouse Divided‚Äù speech, during his 1858 Senate campaign, in which he analyzed the deep divisions between the North and the South and predicted that the country would become more united  ‚Äî   but first slavery had to be eliminated or made the law of the land. She said Lincoln proved to be a president who would go to war to unify the country, and credited President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with mobilizing forces around the country and in Congress in the 1960s to pass civil rights legislation that  ‚Äî   while highly divisive  ‚Äî   also brought greater equality for Americans. ‚ÄúIf Trump was a more disciplined, focused candidate, this could be his moment to win over Americans because the desire for a strong leader is great in moments of turbulence,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut look at his record. After ‚ÄòBrexit,‚Äô he talked about the weak currency helping his golf course. After the Orlando shootings, it was, ‚ÄòI told you so.‚Äô After the F. B. I. report on Hillary, he couldn‚Äôt focus on that. Voters want candidates to show we can trust them, and both candidates have this problem. ‚Äù In several recent polls, roughly   of Americans said that Mrs. Clinton was not honest and trustworthy Mr. Trump drew similar numbers on the question. These polls were conducted before the F. B. I. director rebuked Mrs. Clinton over her private email and handling of classified material. Mr. Trump, whose poll ratings grew after his forceful responses to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. tried to sound similarly resolute on Friday evening, saying in a video that law enforcement was ‚Äúthe force between civilization and total chaos. ‚Äù And, he said, ‚ÄúNow is the time for prayers, love, unity and leadership. ‚Äù These remarks were relatively restrained for him, and his advisers hope that he can build on his image as a powerful,   executive and attempt to unify voters. He is the choice of most voters who say they are particularly interested in electing a strong leader  ‚Äî   a little over   of the electorate, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics survey. A Gallup poll conducted in May showed that six in 10 Americans consider him a strong and decisive leader. Vernita Blocker, a retired social work administrator from Lindenwold, N. J. supports Mrs. Clinton but said she worried that Mr. Trump might be better suited to capitalize on Americans‚Äô concerns about fraying social order. ‚ÄúThe more people are afraid, the more it plays into Trump‚Äôs hands because they will want a   president,‚Äù Ms. Blocker said. ‚ÄúHillary has to find more ways to persuade people that she could really unite the country despite all the people who don‚Äôt like her. ‚Äù Yet Mr. Trump is still having trouble uniting his own party, while Mrs. Clinton appears further along with Democrats. The conventions this month will be huge opportunities for the nominees to galvanize the faithful, but also a chance to reach out to the other side with traditionally positive speeches about their hopes for the country. On policy, Mrs. Clinton is also eager to find common ground on gun control and criminal justice reform  ‚Äî   issues that resonate with many voters at a time of seemingly endless violence. While new gun laws are opposed by many on the right, she wants Americans to at least talk about finding solutions  ‚Äî   if not uniting behind them. ‚ÄúI think ‚Äòunity‚Äô is the wrong goal, and what we need can‚Äôt be achieved by lofty oratory alone,‚Äù said Wendy L. Wall, an associate professor of history at Binghamton University. ‚ÄúOften in our past, unity has meant burying disagreements rather than solving common problems. What we need now is someone who can work across differences, not erase them. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there is no way Trump could do this,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI think the jury is still out on Clinton. ‚Äù",0
19817,"Police Punched, Kicked While on Routine Patrol in Migrant-Dominated Suburb - Breitbart",Virginia Hale,"Police officers were punched, kicked, and attacked with glass bottles in Stockholm on Friday night while on patrol in Rinkeby. [0fficers on patrol in the   suburb were conducting a routine check on a person when they were attacked by a mob of between 20 and 30 people, according to Stockholm police spokesman Eva Nilsson.  She said: ‚ÄúThe fight started when police conducted the check, and all at once a group of people ran out from a place nearby, maybe a restaurant or whatever it was. Exactly how many people were involved is difficult to say, but the officers who were attacked felt that it was between 20 and 30. ‚Äù A statement on the police website says that officers were ‚Äúpunched and kicked in an attack by a large group of people‚Äù and reports that the mob ‚Äúalso threw glass bottles at the patrol‚Äù. Three officers were sent to hospital for their injuries. Ms. Nilsson said that while the area is known to have suffered unrest of late, with residents protesting the high crime rate, Friday‚Äôs   attack was out of the ordinary. She told Expressen: ‚ÄúIt is absolutely unacceptable that this happened during normal service. ‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs a serious thing when police officers who are just acting in their official capacity are attacked in this way. It is a reality which, unfortunately, exists as something which happens now and again for colleagues who work there. ‚Äù Expressen reports that three people, all of whom were born in the 1990s, have been arrested in connection with the attack on suspicion of rioting, assaulting police, and violently resisting arrest. Police in western Stockholm are investigating further into the matter. Though the Swedish Embassy in Hungary denied the existence of ‚Äò  areas‚Äô in Sweden, police last year admitted having lost control in 55 areas where they have great difficulty in attempting to enforce the law. A report released in September revealed the extent of the crisis in police confidence. Due to the dangers police face in the field amidst increasing levels of criminality, 80 per cent of officers are considering a change in career.",0

This group ‚Ä¶ is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.‚Äù‚Äî Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech 
Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law. 
Say hello to America‚Äôs shadow government. 
A corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry. 
No matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government‚Äî also referred to as ‚ÄúThe 7th Floor Group‚Äù ‚Äîmay well have played a part in who will win the White House this year. 
To be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments. 
The first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a ‚Äúcatastrophe.‚Äù COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstances‚Äîa terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdown‚Äîto bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law. 
Yet it is the second shadow government ‚Äîalso referred to as the Deep State‚Äîthat poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù have no real control over our government. 
The Deep State, which ‚Äú operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power ,‚Äù makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government. 
So who or what is the Deep State? 
It‚Äôs the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal   in order to establish themselves as a standing army. It‚Äôs the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. It‚Äôs the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. It‚Äôs the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. It‚Äôs the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, ‚Äúa number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government.‚Äù It‚Äôs what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as ‚Äú a hybrid of national security and   ‚Äù: the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees. 
It‚Äôs every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the government‚Äôs power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics. 
These are the key players that drive the shadow government. 
This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day. 
Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office. 
Domestic surveillance. No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether you‚Äôre walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alike‚Äîincluding homes. Coupled with the nation‚Äôs growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. 
Global spying. The NSA‚Äôs massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion ‚Äú espionage empire ,‚Äù will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSA‚Äôs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the government‚Äôs attempts at political and corporate espionage . 
Roving TSA searches. The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars‚Äô worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers‚Äô valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country. 
USA Patriot Act, NDAA. America‚Äôs so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected. 
Militarized police state. Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local   without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, America‚Äôs law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens. 
SWAT team raids. With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession. 
Domestic drones. The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones. 
School-to-prison pipeline. The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a ‚Äúschoolhouse to jailhouse track‚Äù by imposing a ‚Äúdouble dose‚Äù of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court. 
Overcriminalization. The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided. 
Privatized Prisons. States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years. 
Endless wars. America‚Äôs expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense. 
Are you getting the message yet? 
The next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from what‚Äôs really going on. 
As Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, ‚Äúconcealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue ,‚Äù is a ‚Äúhybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.‚Äù 
The Deep State not only holds the nation‚Äôs capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (‚Äúwhich supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater‚Äù) and Silicon Valley. 
This is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds. 
It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats. 
As Lofgren concludes: 
[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change ‚Ä¶ If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda. 
In other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officials‚Äîelected and unelected alike‚Äîare allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished. 
So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that it‚Äôs just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by America‚Äôs shadow government.",1
19819,Delta Air Lines Bans Disruptive Donald Trump Supporter for Life - The New York Times,Christine Hauser,"Delta Air Lines has banned a disruptive passenger who shouted   Trump and   Clinton remarks at fellow passengers on a flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa. last week,0 the airline‚Äôs chief executive said on Monday. The chief executive, Edward H. Bastian, said in a memo published on Delta‚Äôs website that other travelers on the flight Nov. 22 would receive refunds for their tickets. ‚ÄúThis individual displayed behavior that was loud, rude and disrespectful to his fellow customers,‚Äù Mr. Bastian said in the statement. He added, ‚ÄúWe must require civility on our planes and in our facilities. ‚Äù The decision by Delta came after the airline received criticism on social media for its initial response to the episode, which a passenger identified as Emma Baum videotaped and released online and to news organizations. Ms. Baum was quoted by The Morning Call on Nov. 26 as saying that she had first noticed the man, who was not identified, shouting   slogans in the terminal while waiting to board Flight 248. The man ended up sitting next to her, and she told him she had been out of the country and asked him about the election, she said. Ms. Baum told The Morning Call that as the man became animated, jumping out of his seat, she began recording him with her cellphone. In the video, the man is seen clapping his hands and shouting at other passengers. He says in part: ‚ÄúDonald Trump, baby! We got some Hillary bitches on here?‚Äù The man also yelled: ‚ÄúDonald Trump! It‚Äôs your president. Every goddamn one of you. If you don‚Äôt like it, too bad. ‚Äù A Daily Beast writer was also provided with a copy of the video. Ms. Baum said the man was briefly removed from the plane and then allowed back on the flight before it took off. She said she reported him to the authorities when the plane landed. After the video was posted online, Delta Air Lines issued a  statement on Nov. 26, apologizing to customers for the disruption and saying, ‚ÄúWe have followed up with the teams involved and all agree that this customer should not have been allowed to continue on the flight. ‚Äù Mr. Bastian said in the statement on Monday: ‚ÄúAfter questioning the customer, our team members made the best decision they could given the information they had and allowed him to remain on the flight. ‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIf our colleagues had witnessed firsthand what was shown in the video, there is no question they would have removed him from the aircraft. He will never again be allowed on a Delta plane. ‚Äù The video was shared widely online, with many commentators noting that the man, who is white, was not ejected from the flight, but that passengers who are Muslim, Sikh,   and other races and ethnicities have been subjected to extra scrutiny or outright removal by various airlines while engaging in routine activities. It was not immediately clear what, if any measures, were taken at the airport in Allentown when the man disembarked. Assistant Chief Gail Struss of the Allentown Police Department said in an email on Monday: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible we were called, but no report was taken by us that I can find. We would have referred the caller to the airport police. ‚Äù Officers at the Police Department at the   Airport Authority were not dispatched to respond to any passenger disturbance on Nov. 22, a spokesman, Colin Riccobon, said in an email.",0

19822,Clinton Campaign Demands Intelligence on Possible Russian Efforts to Elect Trump - The New York Times,"Jennifer Steinhauer, Jeremy W. Peters and Amy Chozick","‚ñ†   Donald J. Trump is postponing until January his announcement about how he will handle his private business interests. ‚ñ† The Clint0n campaign breaks its silence and demands declassification of the intelligence on Russian election meddling. ‚ñ† Mr. Trump takes to Twitter to deny Russian involvement in his victory. ‚ñ† Senator John McCain says there is no doubt about Russian hacking, which he called ‚Äúwarfare. ‚Äù ‚ñ† Carly Fiorina for director of national intelligence? She certainly took the  ‚Äôs line on China. For those waiting to see Mr. Trump hold a news conference to discuss the ethical concerns about conflicts with his business, you‚Äôll have to wait a little longer. Transition officials said on Monday evening that they were postponing a news conference scheduled for Thursday at which Mr. Trump had said he would reveal his plans to avoid conflicts of interest with his sprawling real estate business. The   instead will make that announcement in January  ‚Äî   likely before his inauguration and after an extended vacation at his    resort in Florida  ‚Äî   officials said, confirming a report in Bloomberg News. Officials said the focus on building a cabinet had consumed more of Mr. Trump‚Äôs time than expected. And they said that it was taking time to address how to address the large, iconic real estate holdings that are part of the global Trump business. As the swirl of allegations around Russia‚Äôs efforts to elect Mr. Trump roils Washington, one voice has been absent: Hillary Clinton‚Äôs. John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, broke the silence on her behalf, demanding the declassification of all information about Russia‚Äôs meddling as well as an explanation from the Obama administration of what it knew and when it knew it. ‚ÄúWe now know that the C. I. A. has determined Russia‚Äôs interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,‚Äù Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. ‚ÄúThis should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy. ‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is not a partisan issue, and we are glad to see bipartisan support in the Congress for an investigation into Russia‚Äôs role,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe believe that the administration owes it to the American people to explain what it knows regarding the extent and manner of Russia‚Äôs interference and this be done as soon as possible. To that end, we also support the request from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to declassify information around Russia‚Äôs roles in the election and to make this data available to the public. ‚Äù Thrown on the defensive, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that the White House did not announce a major probe of Russia‚Äôs interference before the election partly because many voters would have seen such an announcement as political meddling. He said Russia did not hack the electoral process or the counting of votes. ‚ÄúBut what is also clear is that the results of the hack and leak effort carried out on the orders of Russia were extensively discussed prior to the election,‚Äù Mr. Earnest said. With evidence mounting that Russian intelligence promoted his election, the   continued his denial, via Twitter. That second post is a head scratcher. The United States government  formally accused Russia of   trying to sow discord in the democratic process through its hacking in early October. It stopped short of saying the goal was to elect Mr. Trump. And forensic analysis does allow experts to trace the source of a hack. Oh, and fresh off his shot at Boeing over the cost of an Air Force One upgrade, Mr. Trump took a jab at another expensive military program, the   stealth fighter. On that one, he will have bipartisan support  ‚Äî   just not in congressional districts where the fighter is built. Mr. McCain said on Monday that there was ‚Äúno doubt about the hacking‚Äù by Russian intelligence services into Democratic campaign accounts, which he called ‚Äúanother form of warfare. ‚Äù Appearing on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next minority leader, Mr. McCain said the   investigation of Russian meddling in the election would include his committee as well as the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees. He said a Senate investigation would be necessary despite President Obama having already ordered up an inquiry, as that one would not be completed before the end of the Obama administration. The implication was that the new Trump administration would not follow through. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to point a finger, and I don‚Äôt want this to turn into the Benghazi investigation,‚Äù Mr. Schumer added, referring to the House investigation into the attacks on an American compound in Libya, which he said had been partisan. ‚ÄúThis is serious stuff. ‚Äù One week before the Electoral College meets to ratify Mr. Trump‚Äôs election victory, 10 electors  ‚Äî   including a Texas Republican who has turned on Mr. Trump, and Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Representative Nancy Pelosi  ‚Äî   have demanded their own intelligence briefing on Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump. Their request: Ms. Fiorina, the former   chief executive, emerged from a meeting with the   at Trump Tower on Monday to talk tough, not on Russia but on China, which she called ‚Äúour most important adversary and a rising adversary. ‚Äù Ms. Fiorina was called in to discuss the job of director of national intelligence, a senior transition official said. And Ms. Fiorina, once a bitter foe of Mr. Trump‚Äôs, was effusive. ‚ÄúWe talked about hacking, whether it‚Äôs Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe talked about the opportunity that the   has to literally reset things, to reset the trajectory of this economy, to reset the role of government, to reset America‚Äôs role in the world and how we‚Äôre perceived in the world. And I think it‚Äôs why he‚Äôs getting such fantastic people in his administration. ‚Äù Mr. Trump and Ms. Fiorina clashed bitterly when she ran against him for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump denigrated her appearance last year in an interview with Rolling Stone, saying, ‚ÄúLook at that face!‚Äù Ms. Fiorina briefly agreed to be Senator Ted Cruz‚Äôs   running mate before he, too, was vanquished by the eventual nominee. All appears to be forgiven. ‚ÄúFirst I want to say, he has really cool stuff in his office,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll of these athletes have given him all this incredible memorabilia. I was particular taken by Shaq O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs shoe, which is huge. I guess it takes a champion to know a champion. ‚Äù Three days ago, an image calling for the extermination of Muslims was posted on former Representative Allen West‚Äôs Facebook page. The outrage prompted an aide to Mr. West, a former Army lieutenant colonel, to claim credit and take the image down. The outrage wasn‚Äôt too great to deny Mr. West another audience with the   on Monday at Trump Tower. Nor was it enough to prompt a question from the reporters in the Trump Tower lobby, though they did ask Mr. West about Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump president. Reporters: Should there be a bipartisan investigation of Russia hacking? Mr. West: ‚ÄúI think there are more important things. We‚Äôre about to see a collapse in Syria, Iraq is falling apart. the Iran nuclear deal is horrific. China and Russia are expanding. I think that‚Äôs where we need to focus your intelligence efforts. ‚Äù The Trump transition team officially named Gary D. Cohn, the longtime president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, to be the director of the White House National Economic Council. After a campaign full of attacks on Wall Street  ‚Äî   and Goldman Sachs in particular  ‚Äî   Mr. Trump will have Goldman‚Äôs No. 2 in the West Wing and a former Goldman partner, Steven Mnuchin, next door at Treasury, if he is confirmed. But the transition team tried to find something inspirational in the latest multimillionaire: That is one of the rare moments where Shaker Heights, an affluent suburb of Cleveland, is mined for inspirational struggle. Mr. Trump is looking at appointing a rising Republican star from South Dakota, Representative Kristi Noem, as his secretary of agriculture, a senior official working on the transition said Monday. The transition team is vetting Ms. Noem now, and she is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump this week. Ms. Noem, 45, would be one of the younger members of Mr. Trump‚Äôs cabinet  ‚Äî   a group that so far consists mostly of older men. She has been planning to leave Congress at the end of her next term in 2018 to run for governor of South Dakota. Another name floated for the agriculture job, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is being considered for a variety of jobs, including energy secretary. Because she is a Democrat  ‚Äî   and would likely be replaced in the Senate by a Republican  ‚Äî   the transition official said she could essentially have ‚Äúwhatever job she wants. ‚Äù Speaking of roles, the former Texas governor, Rick Perry, who wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy but could not remember its name on live television, has emerged as a leading candidate for energy secretary. Although Texas is rich in energy and Mr. Perry is big on extracting it, he cannot afford too many ‚Äúoops moments‚Äù if he is named to that post. The Energy Department‚Äôs primary role is to design nuclear weapons and ensure the safety and reliability of the nation‚Äôs aging nuclear arsenal  ‚Äî   through a constellation of scientific laboratories. The two men who served as President Obama‚Äôs energy secretaries were scientists, one with a Nobel Prize, the other from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Trump is also looking at two other possibilities for energy secretary. He likes Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  ‚Äî   both Democrats  ‚Äî   for the job. Both are under tremendous pressure from fellow Democrats not to accept a cabinet job.",0
19823,"Enthralled by Sicily, Again - The New York Times",Francine Prose,"On the subject of travel, my father used to say: ‚ÄúYou can‚Ä0ôt go back. Avoid the places you loved when you were young, because they‚Äôll have changed, and you‚Äôll be disappointed. ‚Äù Occasionally my husband agrees, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, you can‚Äôt go back. ‚Äù But does that mean that the cities and countries where we were happiest and most enchanted must forever be crossed off the list of   destinations? Can‚Äôt some places remain unspoiled (or possibly even improve)? And, at the very least, isn‚Äôt it interesting to see how different a place looks to us at various points in our lives? This spring, I decided to find the answer to some of these questions by revisiting Sicily, one of my favorite places on earth. I‚Äôd first been there in 1992, with my mother, my husband and our two sons (then aged 10 and 14) and written  ‚Äî   for this newspaper  ‚Äî   about watching Mount Etna erupt. I‚Äôd returned for six weeks in early 2002 to write a brief book that was partly about how an immersion in Sicilian history, with its appalling violence and inspiriting record of recovery and resilience, had provided some comfort in the recent aftermath of Sept. 11. Now, almost a quarter century after my first visit, I was returning with my husband, Howie our younger son, Leon our    Jenny and our two granddaughters,    Emilia and    Malena. One advantage of returning to a region you know reasonably well  ‚Äî   and, I suppose, of getting older  ‚Äî   is that you lose the greedy compulsion to go everywhere and see everything. Were this a first visit, or were I alone with Howie, I couldn‚Äôt have resisted Palermo: the glorious mosaics in the cathedral of Monreale, the exuberant Baroque statuary of the Quattro Canti, the vibrant markets and delicious street food. But vivid memories of yanking my sons out of the way of speeding cars and rogue motorini convinced me that it might be more relaxing to begin our vacation in Cefal√π, a seaside town about 40 minutes from Palermo, to which we flew from Rome. We rented a car at the airport (a more efficient process than in years before) and drove to Cefal√π. The first sign of serious improvement was that the traffic seemed less maniacal than I remembered, making the trip more like an ordinary (that is, vaguely harrowing) autostrada drive, and less like a ferocious scramble for survival. We spent three nights in Cefal√π, a beautiful town on the sea. Hugging a curve of the coastline, Cefal√π has a picturesque, mazelike old city and a magnificent cathedral that you can see from far away. In the Duomo is a remarkably     mosaic of Christ Pantocrator in the central apse, just above the Madonna and surrounded by the Twelve Apostles. The village is like a much smaller, more intimate version of Monreale  ‚Äî   without the crowds. During our last stay in Cefal√π, Howie and I returned to the church every few hours to watch the changing light play on the mosaics, but we knew that these obsessive pilgrimages were unlikely to appeal to the girls, who much preferred playing on the beach and in the gentle waves. (One necessity of traveling with family, it became clear, was figuring out  ‚Äî   in advance or on the spot  ‚Äî   the many minor but essential compromises and adjustments that needed to be made.) I‚Äôd very much wanted to revisit the lovely inn and restaurant, Gangivecchio, in an ancient, aristocratic villa in the Madonie mountains above Cefal√π, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how well the children would like the twisty   drive. Instead we took a much shorter (less than a  ) trip to the handsome town of Castelbuono, where we had an extraordinary lunch at Nangalarruni, a   restaurant that specializes in dishes prepared with local mushrooms. The menu includes a marvelous sort of gratin made with potatoes and mushrooms, a medallion of pork encrusted with honey, pistachios and almonds, and pastas with a variety of delectable mushroom sauces. Easily navigable and unpretentious, Castelbuono is also an art town, with   frescoes in the crypt of the church Matrice Vecchia in the castle is a chapel encrusted with the giddily    Baroque decorations of the sculptor Giacomo Serpotta. But by the time we finished lunch, late on a Palm Sunday afternoon, the town seemed to have slipped into a peaceful postprandial sleep, and (in lieu of seeing its art treasures) we settled for buying honey and olive oil in a shop selling produce from a nearby organic cooperative. If you like to cook, as we do, the great frustration of tourism is the inability to shop at local markets and make dinner. One thing that‚Äôs greatly changed travel over the last decade has been the advent of Airbnb and its online gallery of rentable apartments and houses. For us, the fantasy was irresistible: the smell of olive oil and garlic, the family gathered around platters of steaming pasta and seafood bought that very day. We could be like Italians! The reality was somewhat different. The amiable hosts who showed us to our rental cottage in Cefal√π had forgotten to mention the high chance of burning out the clutch as we climbed the driveway, which rounded precipitous curves (without guardrails) along the edge of a cliff, nor did we know (from the online photos) that the only access to the bedrooms was via a   ladder, a problem for two little granddaughters, my       and, to be honest, for me. In Syracuse, where we went next, our elegant, spacious, comfortable apartment, also an Airbnb, had another sort of glitch: The electricity had been turned off in a country where, we well knew, it could be weeks for it to be turned back on. Perhaps my father should have said: You can‚Äôt go back and rent an apartment. Ultimately, these issues, which featured   moments evoking ‚ÄúNational Lampoon‚Äôs Vacation‚Äù films, hardly mattered. Our little family fled both Airbnbs and checked into local hotels, the gracious and comfortable La Plumeria in Cefal√π, and in Syracuse, after our genuinely kindly, regretful landlady refunded our money, (though our Cefal√π ‚Äúhost‚Äù refused) the elegant Algil√†. When the travelers who had come for Easter filled its rooms, we moved again to the   seafront Hotel des √âtrangers. In Syracuse, we stayed on Ortigia, the lovely island across a small bridge from the mainland. Though there were far more restaurants and souvenir shops than I recalled from my previous visits, Ortigia‚Äôs architecture, the atmospheric cobbled streets, the dramatic waterfront and especially the Piazza del Duomo (particularly beautiful when illuminated at night) were no less thrilling than I remembered. Nor was it any less fascinating to observe the layers of history so visible everywhere throughout the city. On one side of the Duomo, you can see the columns that upheld the structure during its original iteration as a Greek temple consecrated as a Christian church in the seventh century, the Norman cathedral was rebuilt, in its current Baroque splendor, after the earthquake of 1693. Among Syracuse‚Äôs wonders is one of Caravaggio‚Äôs major  ‚Äî   and most beautiful  ‚Äî   paintings, ‚ÄúThe Burial of St. Lucia,‚Äù which was done in 1608 when the artist briefly took refuge in Sicily, on the run from a murder charge in Rome. The painting, temporarily housed in the church Santa Lucia alla Badia, on one side of the Piazza Duomo, depicts the interment of the city‚Äôs patron saint, her delicate frame stretched out near the bottom of the canvas, surrounded by mourners and half blocked from our sight by the broad, powerful back of the gravedigger all this  ‚Äî   the action of the painting, as it were  ‚Äî   transpires in a narrow band, beneath a vast expanse of empty dark space that has been restored since I last saw it (then in Syracuse‚Äôs art museum) to reveal a brick niche, dimly visible in the sepulchral gloom. On the mainland, a short cab or bus ride (or longer walk) from Ortigia, is Syracuse‚Äôs archaeological zone, a sort of classical entertainment center featuring one of the largest and most impressive Greek theaters in existence, as well as an elliptical Roman arena that often served as the stage (and could be flooded) for simulated naval battles. In the same park are a series of caverns, or latomie. Now surrounded by a pleasant garden planted with lemon and orange trees and heavily populated by songbirds, are the caves that were used as prisons by the region‚Äôs despotical rulers. Perhaps the most   of these caves, the Ear of Dionysius, was (at least supposedly) given its name by Caravaggio, who observed the way in which the cave‚Äôs entrance resembles an enormous ear. Our granddaughters loved running in and out of these dark, slightly daunting natural wonders, and were suitably impressed by the unusual acoustics, where the slightest whisper can be heard throughout the cavern. Legend has it that this feature was used by the rulers to eavesdrop on the conversations of the unsuspecting prisoners, though it seems more probable that this natural amplification was ingeniously employed to increase the audibility of the plays performed in the Greek theater. As in much of Sicily, the food in Syracuse is  ‚Äî   to put it simply  ‚Äî   great. One of the best meals we had on our trip was at Burgio, a sort of upscale   grocery store and restaurant in one corner of Ortigia‚Äôs appealing market. Burgio focuses on local produce  ‚Äî   cheeses, sausages and salamis. They serve sandwiches made to order, artisanal beers, local wines and elaborate platters on which are arranged small dishes of sliced meats, fish, cheese and marinated vegetables, each selection paired with perfectly complementary relishes. Eating at Burgio was our consolation for not being able to shop in, and cook from, the market, but it was by no means the only excellent restaurant in Ortigia. Walking around, checking out menus, it‚Äôs not hard to find someplace where the food is superb and not terribly expensive. We especially liked Sicilia in Tavola, which has a terrific selection of seafood dishes  ‚Äî   and pasta Bolognese for the girls!  ‚Äî   and where I had pasta with sea urchin, pasta ai ricci, a dish with which I am obsessed and order every chance I get. We also liked a place called DiVino Mare, which is near the market and serves grilled, wonderfully fresh fish at unusually reasonable prices. We spent much of our time (four days) in Syracuse just walking around and eating. I would have liked to spend more time traveling up and down the Ionian Sea coast, and to the inland mountain towns of Ragusa and Modica. I‚Äôd hoped to take the family to the fish market in Catania, where once, eating pasta with sea urchin in a little trattoria at the edge of the pescheria, I watched the restaurant and the market stalls empty as everyone gathered to marvel at a gargantuan tuna that one of the fishermen had brought in. I would have liked to have lunch at the coastal beauty spots Aci Trezza and Aci Castello, and to visit Noto, the wildly Baroque town where every cornice and window sill appears to vie for the greatest complexity of decoration, and where a balcony might be upheld by mermaids, griffins or galloping horses carved from stone. I would have liked to make a side trip to the Villa Romana del Casale, near Piazza Armerina, a restored Roman villa with famously spectacular mosaics depicting a chariot race, an epic hunting scene, a parade of women in what appear to be bikinis. But of the three generations traveling together, each one had their own reasons for wanting to relax, to take things slow and easy. Ultimately, some of the most pleasurable moments were the most unexpected, and the ones that most fully disproved my father‚Äôs warning against returning to the familiar. I had an experience of pure bliss, riding through the gently rolling, unusually green Sicilian countryside between Cefal√π and Syracuse, looking at ruins of ancient farmhouses and flocks of grazing sheep, and hearing my granddaughters sing at the top of their lungs along with Adele‚Äôs ‚ÄúHello. ‚Äù Perhaps my favorite moment of the entire trip occurred at Segesta, where there is an unfinished but nonetheless grand Doric temple and an amphitheater (dating from the third century B. C.) on a hill above the temple. The structures are themselves magnificent, but their beauty is greatly enhanced by the setting: a semideserted,     (about 40 minutes from Palermo) and wholly rural mountaintop from which you can see far across the bucolic countryside and, beyond it, the sea. Of Sicily‚Äôs three major Greek temples  ‚Äî   at Agrigento, Selinunte and Segesta  ‚Äî   Segesta was the one I wanted my family to see, the one I wanted to revisit myself. When we reached Segesta, after getting lost in search of a nearby lunch spot, it was midafternoon. The busloads of tourists and Italian schoolchildren had mostly departed. We took the shuttle bus up to the amphitheater, where a strong wind was blowing, and where  ‚Äî   as their parents and grandparents sat on the stone benches encircling the theater and took in the view  ‚Äî   the girls ran up and down the levels like graceful little mountain goats and treated the ancient theater as their personal terraced playground. From the shuttle bus, going back downhill, you suddenly see the temple, solitary and majestic, exerting a kind of presence you can feel even from afar. The bus driver stopped so his passengers could take a picture, and I had the sense that even he  ‚Äî   navigating this road, day after day  ‚Äî   had never reached the point of taking the temple‚Äôs beauty for granted, and was still awed by its magnificence. The hike from the parking area to the temple is slightly steep and long. Leon and Howie and the girls ran up ahead, while I walked more slowly to keep my    company. By the time we reached the temple, the girls had made it their own. Malena, who never walks when she can run, was scrambling over the rocks that surrounded the structure, inspecting every inch of the hilly area around the monumental columns. Emilia was having quite a different reaction. In the open space, with the temple behind her, she seemed to have become intoxicated by the gorgeousness of the place. With her arms outstretched she twirled and twirled around, the afternoon sunlight shining through her pale skirt and picking out the highlights in her long reddish brown hair. Graceful and free, powered by the sheer joy of being a child, by the happiness of finding herself in such an astonishing spot, she turned and turned and turned. Watching her, I thought: You can go back. This is better. Returning can be better than seeing a place for the first time. The temple at Segesta had never before seemed to me so striking, so timeless, so precious. I thought: This  ‚Äî   right here, right now  ‚Äî   is the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen.

19824,Clinton to Trump on Twitter: ‚ÄòDelete Your Account‚Äô - The New York Times,Daniel Victor,"Look, we don‚Ä0ôt want to write about every presidential campaign tweet that teeters on the brink of the absurd like a   mirror revealing the political Frankentheater that the entire electorate has collaborated to create, whether actively or by submission. We‚Äôd never get anything else done. But O. K. fine, this one could use some explanation. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was responding to a tweet from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee: Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs missive, most likely written and sent by her campaign staff, quickly became one of the most widely shared tweets of the 2016 campaign. It was precisely the kind of tweet that political junkies, and anyone else checking Twitter for a midday distraction, thirsts for in the middle of the afternoon when they‚Äôd prefer to think about something other than work. But it‚Äôs worth noting, to the unfamiliar, that ‚ÄúDelete your account‚Äù was not a sudden turn of phrase by a coldblooded social media manager, let alone the candidate herself. The   phrase has a long history as a dismissive rejoinder, especially on Twitter. It translates roughly as ‚ÄúYour tweet or opinion is so bad that you should be immediately disqualified from further participation on the platform. ‚Äù Mr. Trump then responded, and other political figures quickly jumped on board. Mrs. Clinton has not always been totally hip, jiggy and on fleek with the cool kids. She was widely panned for a tweet in August that struck some watchers as a tad too pandering. On Friday, a day after it was announced that Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, was endorsing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump unleashed a typical tweet, mocking the senator‚Äôs heritage. But Ms. Warren, who has taken to matching the Republican taunt for taunt on social media, could not resist resurrecting Clinton‚Äôs tack. There. Now you understand politics again.",0
19825,"These Products Make Men Grow Breasts, Get Cancers Of The Prostate And Liver",Eddy Lavine,"posted by Eddie Owned by Unilever, the Axe brand includes a range of men‚Ä1ôs grooming products with many of the ingredients never even tested for safety according to the C.I.R. ‚Äì Cosmetic Ingredient Review. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals. Axe products are loaded with endocrine disrupting chemicals. Endocrine disruptorsare exogenous, synthetic chemicals that have hormone-like effects on both humans and wild-life and interfere with the endocrine system by either mimicking or blocking our natural hormones and disrupting their respective body functions. Member scientists of the Endocrine Society issued a report in which they claim: ‚ÄúWe present the evidence that endocrine disruptors have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostrate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology.‚Äù New studies are also revealing that these harmful chemicals may be causing physical feminization in males. A study published by the International Journal of Andrology found that feminization of boys can now be seen through their play habits. Medical experts are now wondering whether exposure to years of these toxic chemicals is part of the reason so many older men are low on testosterone and experiencing erectile dysfunction. So they take a little blue pill and get exposed to even more chemicals and the cycle continues. Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly is the active ingredient in Axe deodorant products. One or more animal studies show kidney or renal system effects at very low doses, mammalian cells show positive mutation results, animal studies show reproductive effects at moderate doses. Aluminum was first recognized as a human neurotoxin in 1886, before being used as an antiperspirant. A neurotoxin is a substance that causes damage to nerves or nerve tissue. Cocamidopropyl Betaine Cocamidopropyl betaine is a very toxic ingredient which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. The biggest danger of using a product with cocamidopropyl betaine is its potential contamination with nitrosamines . Nitrosamines are created when nitrosating agents are combined with amines. Nitrosamines have been identified as one of the most potent classes of carcinogens, having caused cancer in more than 40 different animal species as well as in humans. PPG-14 Butyl Ether PPG stands for popypropylene glycol, which is made from a completely artificial petroleum product, methyl oxirane. Another name for that is propylene oxide (which is a probable human carcinogen). Propylene oxide is also an irritant and highly flammable. Butyl ethers are in the paraben family, and they are toluene derivatives (toxic petrochemical compounds). Toluene has proven to have a harmful affect on the reproductive system while parabens have been linked to cancer. PEG-8 Distearate According to a report in the International Journal of Toxicology by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee, impurities found in various PEG compounds include ethylene oxide; 1,4-dioxane; polycyclic aromatic compounds; and heavy metals such as lead, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic. Many of these impurities are linked to cancer. A 1988 Swedish study by Thompson looked at both BHT and BHA. They found that both were toxic and tumour promoting. Both antioxidants were observed to be cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 100 to 750 microM. At equimolar concentrations BHT was more cytotoxic than BHA. source:",1

La ruta y la misi√≥n del portaaviones Almirante Kuznetsov, seg√∫n el secretario de prensa del presidente de la Federaci√≥n de Rusia, Dmitri Peskov, se encuentran en un sobre cerrado en el que se lee ‚ÄúCompletamente secreto‚Äù. 
Sin embargo, seg√∫n informaba anteriormente el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores espa√±ol, se preve√≠a que el portaaviones llegara al puerto de Ceuta el 28 de octubre . En Madrid se√±alan que el permiso correspondiente se expidi√≥ el pasado mes de septiembre. 
No obstante, en cuanto la noticia sobre la inminente llegada de los buques a Ceuta lleg√≥ a la prensa, Espa√±a comenz√≥ a recibir cr√≠ticas de sus aliados en la OTAN. 
El secretario general de la Alianza, Jens Stoltenberg, se√±al√≥ que en otras condiciones no tendr√≠a nada que objetar al abastecimiento de los buques rusos, pero que en la actualidad est√° extremadamente preocupado porque estos ‚Äúpuedan utilizarse para atacar Alepo‚Äù. 
Otros pol√≠ticos de Gran Breta√±a y EE UU hicieron declaraciones similares. 
En Espa√±a las cr√≠ticas m√°s duras que ha recibido el gobierno provienen de Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. Su servicio de prensa ha confirmado a Kommersant que los miembros del Congreso de los Diputados de este partido han exigido al ministro de Asuntos Exteriores en funciones, Jos√© Manuel Garc√≠a-Margallo y al ministro de Defensa en funciones, Pedro Moren√©s, que expliquen por qu√© raz√≥n unos barcos rusos que participan en la operaci√≥n siria hacen escala en Ceuta. 9 cosas que no sab√≠as sobre el portaaviones ‚ÄúAlmirante Kuznetsov‚Äù 
Las autoridades portuarias de las ciudad han expresado su descontento por lo sucedido. Desde el a√±o 2011 por este puerto han pasado, seg√∫n el El Pa√≠s , m√°s de 60 buques rusos. 
‚ÄúLos criterios para permitir la escala en Ceuta son la seguridad del medio ambiente, de la ciudad y de su poblaci√≥n‚Äù, cita el peri√≥dico The Spain Report a fuentes en la administraci√≥n del puerto. Sin embargo, debido al aluvi√≥n de cr√≠ticas recibidas, el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Espa√±a anunci√≥ ayer que ‚Äúiba a celebrar una consulta para estudiar la decisi√≥n‚Äù. 
Hacia el mediod√≠a de ayer la embajada de Rusia en Madrid comunic√≥ a Exteriores que retiraba la petici√≥n de permisos de escala para la escala de los buques y, por lo tanto, quedan canceladas. ‚ÄúConfirmamos que nuestros barcos no entrar√°n en el puerto de Ceuta porque se ha modificado su ruta‚Äù, declaraban desde la embajada. La reacci√≥n de Mosc√∫ 
Vasili Nioradze, secretario de prensa de la embajada, instaba a no dramatizar la situaci√≥n en declaraciones a Kommersant. 
‚ÄúLa negociaci√≥n sobre este tipo de escalas en los puertos es un procedimiento rutinario ‚Äìse√±alaba este-. Nosotros enviamos la solicitud de forma anticipada y para tomar una decisi√≥n al respecto se tiene en cuenta el derecho internacional y los requisitos del pa√≠s. En esta ocasi√≥n se ha decidido una cosa, y en otros casos la respuesta ser√° distinta‚Äù. 
√çgor Konashenkov, representante oficial del Ministerio de Defensa explica que el departamento ruso contemplaba la posibilidad ‚Äúde la escala acordada con el gobierno espa√±ol de algunos buques o embarcaciones de apoyo de la flotilla rusa‚Äù. 
Sin embargo, seg√∫n el representante del Ministerio de Defensa ruso, no se envi√≥ ninguna solicitud oficial. 
Adem√°s, comenta: ‚ÄúLos representantes del gobierno espa√±ol han declarado que debido a la presi√≥n de Estados Unidos y de la OTAN el paso de buques rusos por el puerto de Ceuta no es oportuno‚Äù. Las autoridades de Espa√±a no han hecho ninguna declaraci√≥n similar en p√∫blico. Madrid ha perdido dinero 
El director del Centro de An√°lisis de Estrategias y Tecnolog√≠a, Rusl√°n P√∫jov, no ve ninguna tragedia en el cambio de ruta del Almirante Kuznetsov. 
‚ÄúNuestros buques pueden repostar sin problemas en Argelia o en Malta. Apuesto por Argelia, ya que Malta es miembro de la UE y se enfrentar√° a los mismos problemas que Espa√±a‚Äù, informa el experto a Kommersant . 
Seg√∫n P√∫jov, la llegada del grupo del Almirante Kuznetsov a Siria apenas cambiar√° la correlaci√≥n de fuerzas en la regi√≥n, aunque s√≠ permitir√° a Rusia elevar su prestigio internacional. 
‚ÄúLos franceses tienen un portaaviones en la regi√≥n porque no tienen base, pero nosotros s√≠ que tenemos‚Äìdeclara el experto-. La misi√≥n del Kuznetsov es m√°s bien una operaci√≥n de entrenamiento. Los pilotos de los aviones navales necesitan entrenar y Siria les ofrece la posibilidad de hacerlo en condiciones de combate reales‚Äù. 
El experto del mismo centro Andr√©i Frolov a√±ade que la expedici√≥n del Almirante Kuznetsov tambi√©n tiene un ‚Äúcomponente publicitario‚Äù: La India est√° pensando en comprar cazas navales MiG-29K/KUB para sus futuros portaaviones, y la demostraci√≥n de sus caracter√≠sticas en Siria podr√≠a ayudarle a decidirse‚Äù.

23 year old Munir al-Adam has been sentenced to death for alleged ‚Äúattacks on police‚Äù during protests in the predominately Shi‚Äôite Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia in late 2011. 
Al-Adam is partly blind and was already partially deaf at the time when the Saudi forces arrested him, however, he is now fully deaf in one ear because of police brutality while in custody. 
Al-Adam‚Äôs family say his confession to any crime was extracted under torture. 
‚ÄúMunir Adam‚Äôs appalling case illustrates how the Saudi authorities are all too happy to subject the most vulnerable people to the swordsman‚Äôs blade ‚Äì including juveniles and people with disabilities,‚Äù said Reprieve‚Äôs Death Penalty Team Director Maya Foa. 
‚ÄúLike so many others, Munir was arrested for allegedly attending protests, and tortured into a ‚Äòconfession‚Äô ‚Äì he was beaten so badly that he lost his hearing. It‚Äôs a scandal that Munir now faces beheading on the basis of a bogus statement that he has since recanted,‚Äù she added.

19831,Chelsea Manning Describes Bleak Life in a Men‚Äôs Prison - The New York Times,Charlie Savage,"Most mornings at 4:30, half an hour before the ‚Äúfirst call‚Äù awakens inmates at the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas, an alarm rings within an    cell. Inmate 89289, slightly built with short hair, rises to apply makeup and don female undergarments and a brown uniform before the   men in the adjacent cells stir. That is the routine for Chelsea Manning, America‚Äôs most famous convicted leaker and the prison‚Äôs most unusual inmate. She is serving the longest sentence ever imposed for disclosing government secrets  ‚Äî   35 years  ‚Äî   and her status as a celebrity of sorts and an incarcerated transgender woman presents continuing difficulties for the military. During the day, Ms. Manning, who was an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks in 2010, builds picture frames and furniture in the prison wood shop. In the evenings, before the 10:05 p. m. lockdown, she reads through streams of letters, including from antisecrecy enthusiasts who view her as a  . ‚ÄúI am always busy. I have a backlog of things to do: legal, administrative, press inquiries, and writing  ‚Äî   lots of writing,‚Äù Ms. Manning wrote in response to questions submitted by The Times because the Army does not permit her to speak directly to journalists. ‚ÄúBeing me is a   job. ‚Äù But Ms. Manning, who is struggling to transition to life as a woman while enduring a bleak existence at a male military prison, has asked President Obama to commute the remainder of her sentence before he leaves office next week. She poses particular challenges as a prisoner, with a volunteer support network that helps bring global attention to her treatment, fragile mental state  ‚Äî   she twice tried to commit suicide in 2016  ‚Äî   and need for treatment that the military has no experience providing. Her request comes as the world is again focused on WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, whom her leaks made famous. The organization last year published Clinton campaign emails, obtained in a hacking, as part of what American intelligence officials claim was a covert Russian operation aimed at tilting the election to   Donald J. Trump. (Ms. Manning declined to discuss WikiLeaks, saying only that her decision to send documents to it ‚Äúwas neither an endorsement nor an affiliation. ‚Äù) It also comes at a time of flux in the military‚Äôs policies on gender identity. Last June, the Obama administration rescinded a ban on transgender people serving in the military and began overhauling its practices, which eventually would include providing gender reassignment surgery. But Mr. Trump has derided the lifting of the ban as ‚Äúpolitically correct,‚Äù raising the possibility that his administration may roll back the changes. The White House declined to comment on Ms. Manning‚Äôs commutation request. The Army declined to comment about her situation at Fort Leavenworth, citing privacy laws. A military prosecutor had called Ms. Manning a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù at her 2013   and officials have said the disclosures disrupted government operations and put people at risk, although prosecutors did not claim anyone was killed because of them. In a statement accompanying her petition asking Mr. Obama to reduce her sentence to the nearly seven years she already has served, Ms. Manning, now 29, said she never intended to hurt anyone and pleaded for a chance to start her life over. ‚ÄúI need help,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI am living through a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss, and depression. I cannot focus. I cannot sleep. I attempted to take my own life. ‚Äù On Aug. 22, 2013, the day after her sentencing for sending documents to WikiLeaks, Ms. Manning‚Äôs lawyer read a statement on the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show announcing that she was female, wanted to be called ‚ÄúChelsea‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúBradley‚Äù and would seek   hormone therapy. To observers of her   this was no surprise. Her motivation for leaking hundreds of thousands of files she had copied from a classified computer network while serving in Iraq, as she wrote at the time, was hope that they would spark ‚Äúworldwide discussion, debates, and reforms. ‚Äù But at her trial, she apologized and noted that she was ‚Äúdealing with a lot of issues‚Äù when she had made that decision. Testimony showed that she had been in a mental and emotional crisis as she came to grips, in the stress of a war zone, with the fact that she was not merely gay, as she had believed while growing up in Oklahoma, but had gender dysphoria  ‚Äî   a disconnect between one‚Äôs gender identity and sex assigned at birth. In the months before her leaks and May 2010 arrest, she had been behaving erratically and emailed a picture of herself wearing a woman‚Äôs wig to her supervisor. The military sent Ms. Manning to serve out her sentence as a   inmate at the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks, its main prison for male inmates. Court documents show that Ms. Manning has had counseling sessions with a prison psychologist, Dr. Ellen Galloway, at least once a week, and military authorities have over time allowed her access to some treatments doctors prescribed for her gender dysphoria, in part because of pressure from a lawsuit filed by Chase Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, in September 2014. She can now wear female prison undergarments, including a sports bra, and ‚Äúsubdued cosmetics. ‚Äù In early 2015, she was permitted to get speech therapy to feminize the tone and pitch of her voice and began   hormone therapy prescribed, Mr. Strangio said, by an endocrinologist brought in from the military‚Äôs Walter Reed hospital. Since then, Ms. Manning wrote, she has developed breasts and curvier hips. ‚ÄúThere have been significant changes since I‚Äôve been taking the hormones, and I am happy with them,‚Äù she said. But, citing security risks, the military rejected the recommendation of an outside psychologist who said she should be permitted to further feminize her appearance by growing her hair longer than male military standards. Mr. Strangio is helping her challenge that restriction. ‚ÄúPlaintiff feels like a freak and a weirdo  ‚Äî   not because having short hair makes a person less of a woman  ‚Äî   but because for her, it undermines specifically recommended treatment and sends the message to everyone that she is not a ‚Äòreal‚Äô woman,‚Äù he wrote in a court filing. ‚ÄúShe is getting hormones, but it sounds like the inability to socially transition, or to have surgery, could be contributing to suicidality  ‚Äî   especially when she is looking at decades in prison and thus a certain hopelessness about whether that might ever be available for her,‚Äù said Dan Karasic, a University of California, San Francisco psychiatrist and the chairman of the American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs work group on gender dysphoria he cautioned that he had not examined her. The military turned down a request by The New York Times to visit the facility. But an Army spokesman, Wayne Hall, provided written answers from the Army Corrections Command to questions posed by The Times, from which a sketch of her environment emerged. Ms. Manning‚Äôs cell, like others at Fort Leavenworth, contains a bed, toilet, sink, locker, storage bin, chair and desk, according to the Army. She showers in a nearby communal bathroom with individual stalls. She has no access to the internet, but says she receives ‚Äúat least a couple hundred pieces of mail every week. ‚Äù The Army does not permit her to see people who did not know her before her incarceration, so she is not allowed to meet with a handful of volunteers who have formed an informal network of supporters, but she calls one of them daily. A volunteer who relayed questions from The Times to her asked not to be named, citing security concerns. Ms. Manning said she recently finished reading ‚ÄúSuperintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,‚Äù a book about artificial intelligence by the Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom, and ‚Äú1Q84,‚Äù a dystopian novel by Haruki Murakami. She is interested in efforts to develop stronger encryption and has been ‚Äúgoing through‚Äù the ‚ÄúPrinceton Companion to Mathematics. ‚Äù She also said she reads women‚Äôs athletic, fashion and lifestyle magazines like Shape, Vogue, Vanity Fair and Cosmopolitan. Her cell door has a window looking onto a central ‚Äúday room‚Äù with tables, chairs, pay phones and televisions. For a time, Ms. Manning played Dungeons  Dragons with a few fellow inmates, but she said she had had no time in recent months. She eats meals with other inmates in a dining facility and works on a team at the wood shop. The roughly 424 inmates held at Fort Leavenworth with Ms. Manning include men accused of routine crimes as well as some who drew public attention, including Nidal Hasan, convicted in a 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood and held on the prison‚Äôs death row wing, and Robert Bales, who murdered 16 Afghans in Kandahar and was sentenced to life without parole in August 2013. Ms. Manning declined to say much about the guards or fellow inmates, other than to say that they have never bullied or attacked her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs best to keep to yourself and try not to get involved in any drama,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little harder for me to keep to myself, since the staff is constantly watching me and those that interact with me. But I‚Äôm used to it by now. I don‚Äôt feel threatened by the other prisoners. I have friends. ‚Äù Her special status at Fort Leavenworth is evident. Nancy Hollander, one of the lawyers working on the appeal of her conviction and sentence, said the Army built a special secure information facility in a windowless basement room so she could meet with them and discuss   documents she leaked. While Ms. Manning said she could not say on her monitored phone calls ‚Äúanything critical of the prison or the current administration or I can get charged for violation of a lawful general order,‚Äù her supporters pay close attention to her treatment. Scrutiny of the military‚Äôs struggles to deal with Ms. Manning go back to her confinement at the Quantico, Va. brig after her arrest, when she was held for months in isolation, shackled during exercise and sometimes stripped of clothing and glasses to prevent her from harming herself  ‚Äî   even after a prison psychologist said such steps were unnecessary. A military judge ruled that the treatment had been illegal. At Leavenworth, after a minor disagreement with a guard in 2015, officials punished her, among other things, for ‚Äúmedical misuse‚Äù because they found a tube of toothpaste in her cell that was past its expiration date. Her supporters publicized the incident. In September, her supporters issued a news release saying she was on a hunger strike because of an ‚Äúoverzealous administrative scrutiny‚Äù and lack of progress in getting more treatment. She resumed eating after five days. Mr. Strangio said an official told her she would be eligible for the same medical treatment as   transgender soldiers, suggesting she would eventually be permitted to proceed with surgery. But months have passed, and Ms. Manning wrote that she has not seen a surgeon. Later in September, a prison board disciplined Ms. Manning for the disruption a July suicide attempt had caused. The punishment: solitary confinement. While in isolation in October, she tried again to kill herself  ‚Äî   by choking herself on a piece of clothing, according to a support network member  ‚Äî   before guards intervened. About a week further into that stint in solitary, she experienced a bizarre episode in which four people impersonating guards simulated breaking into the prison one night and pretended to kill her regular guards, filling her with fear, according to an account she filed with the army inspector general. A military official denied her account. Dr. Stuart Grassian, a specialist in the psychological effects of solitary confinement, said her description is consistent with hallucinations often experienced by unstable people placed in isolation. Now, with 28 years of her sentence to go and uncertainty over whether the Trump administration will deny her   surgery, Ms. Manning is hoping Mr. Obama will take mercy on her and free her from military prison, which goes by the acronym U. S. D. B. ‚ÄúI am not asking for a pardon of my conviction. I understand that the various collateral consequences of the   conviction will stay on my record forever,‚Äù she wrote in her commutation application. ‚ÄúI am merely asking for a first chance to live my life outside the U. S. D. B. as the person I was born to be. ‚Äù",0

19833,"Donald Trump, Chicago Police: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Karen Zraick and Lisa Iaboni,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here‚Äôs the  .) Good evening. Here‚Äôs the latest. We‚Äôll be off on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. See you Tuesday. 1. The House joined the Senate in laying the groundwork for speedy action to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Donald J. Trump again attacked Hillary Clinton over her emails on Twitter. We took a look at the first cabinets of the past few presidents, and determined that Mr. Trump‚Äôs will be the least diverse since that of President Ronald Reagan. _____ 2. A Justice Department report found the Chicago police systematically violated the civil rights of residents, particularly   and Latinos, by using excessive force. The report came in the wake of the city‚Äôs highest murder rate in 20 years in 2016. In an effort to fix the problems, federal and city officials reached a preliminary agreement on changes to police practices. _____ 3. Takata pleaded guilty to charges stemming from its handling of defective airbags, and will pay $1 billion in penalties. Three of its executives face criminal charges. The airbags can rupture violently when they deploy. They have been linked to at least 11 deaths, which prompted the largest automotive recall in American history. _____ 4. Chelsea Manning is asking Mr. Obama to commute her sentence before he leaves office next week. Ms. Manning, who was an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks in 2010, is serving a   sentence. She is struggling to transition to life as a woman in a male prison, and attempted suicide twice last year. _____ 5. China has banned child abuse at its infamous digital detox boot camps. There are just a few of the camps, but they‚Äôre known for harsh treatment, including beatings and electroshock therapy to get children offline. The law also sets a daily limit on how long minors can play online games at home or in internet cafes. _____ 6. Thousands of members of the New York Police Department attended the funeral of Officer Steven McDonald, who was paralyzed in a 1986 shooting but became a symbol of forgiveness and hope. Officer McDonald had less than two years on the job when he was shot by a    in Central Park. He publicly forgave his attacker and eventually traveled the globe, speaking of his Roman Catholic faith and the importance of compassion. He died on Tuesday at 59, several days after a heart attack. _____ 7. The U. S. Mint will release a commemorative gold coin featuring Lady Liberty as a black woman. It‚Äôs the first time that she‚Äôs been depicted as anything other than white on the nation‚Äôs currency. The coin will have a $100 face value and goes on sale April 6 to commemorate the 225th anniversary of the mint‚Äôs coin production. _____ 8. What‚Äôs the right time to put your home on the market? Whenever you want. A real estate article of faith once had it that   to   the start of the   spring season, was the best time to list a property. But now that everyone looks at listings online, realtors say the rules about timing have gone out the window. _____ 9. If one of your vacation goals is inspiring envy in others, you may want to bookmark these tips on how to take great travel photos. Make a list of key shots, shoot at sunrise and sunset and experiment with angles. And after all that planning, don‚Äôt forget to be spontaneous. _____ 10. Finally, we bring you the back story of the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe‚Äôs white dress fluttering up as she stands over a subway grate in ‚ÄúThe Seven Year Itch. ‚Äù What made it into the movie was actually a reshoot of a discarded and more risqu√© scene filmed on the Upper East Side in the summer of 1954. The discarded version happened to also be captured on   film by an amateur filmmaker who lived nearby. Jules Schulback often talked about the footage, but no one saw it for 50 years, until he was 92 and his granddaughter found it.

19835,"Not Just Bees, Trees Are Dying Off at an Alarming Rate With Little Public Attention",WakingTimes,"Wak1ng Times 
In the background of modern life, as people go on debating politics and working for a living, something dreadful is happening to the eco-systems which support us. Major disasters like the ongoing radioactive leak at Fukushima , the apocalyptic fires burning throughout Indonesia , even bee colony collapse disorder , seem to fall out of view in day-to-day life, as we seem to have lost our power and will to directly participate in the stewardship of planet earth. 
A new crisis is now happening all around us affecting trees. It appears that millions, hundreds of millions even, of trees are dying in North America and around the world from a basket of reasons, promising to completely and permanently alter the landscape and environment around us. 
Tree are among the most abundant and the most critical organisms on planet earth, and only recently have we been able to assess just how many trees inhabit planet earth. A study published in 2015 gave us this picture: 
‚ÄúA new study published in Nature estimates the planet has 3.04 trillion trees. The research says 15.3 billion trees are chopped down every year. It also estimates that 46% of the world‚Äôs trees have been cleared over the past 12,000 years.‚Äù [ Source ] 
Now in 2016, alarm bells are ringing and in California alone, the problem has become incredibly severe: 
‚ÄúThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced today that the U.S. Forest Service has identified an additional 36 million dead trees across California since its last aerial survey in May 2016. This brings the total number of dead trees since 2010 to over 102 million on 7.7 million acres of California‚Äôs drought stricken forests. In 2016 alone, 62 million trees have died, representing more than a 100 percent increase in dead trees across the state from 2015. Millions of additional trees are weakened and expected to die in the coming months and years.‚Äù [ Source ] 
A New York Times feature on trees in California warns us that many of the state‚Äôs trees were already dead before forest fires moved in, thereby making the fire situation worse. Beyond California 
Many of the tree deaths in Northern California have been linked to Sudden Oak Death in addition to an ongoing drought, but, the tragic die-off of trees is far from limited to California. In 2010, Hawaii‚Äôs well ohi‚Äôa trees began to die on the Big Island due to a disease now referred to as ohi‚Äôa disease, and scientists still don‚Äôt understand its origins or how to treat it. These are just a few examples of many in a wave of issues killing trees in many parts of America and around the world. 
‚ÄòThe plight of the ohi‚Äôa is not unique ‚Äì it‚Äôs part of a quiet crisis playing out in forests across America. Drought, disease, insects and wildfire are chewing up tens of millions of trees at an incredible pace, much of it driven by climate change.‚Äù [ Source ] 
Entire mountainsides are dying off in short order, leaving a bleak future for wildlife and residents. Some speculate that the widespread loss of trees due to such a wide conflagration of issues is a sign that trees, the most rugged of all plants, are in general weakened from an environment under complex attack by pollution and even climate engineering projects. 
‚ÄúIn California and in other parts of the world, many are making the connection between climate engineering these tree die-offs. Also known as geoengineering , this is the modification of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere with the supplementation of compounds and chemicals, ostensibly as a means of favorably influencing the climate.‚Äù [ Source ] 
Could be, although there is nothing like a consensus on the issue of why trees are in such a weakened state that so many are succumbing to so many issues. Thousands of trees killed by mountain pine beetles in western Rocky Mountain national park. 
A Planet Out of Balance ‚ÄúNatural ecosystems have been altered in various ways by nitrogen, sulfur, and mercury deposited in rain, snow, or as gases and particles in the atmosphere. Through decades of scientific research, scientists have documented how local, regional, and global sources of air pollution can produce profound changes in ecosystems. These changes include acidification of soils and surface waters, harmful algal blooms and low oxygen conditions in estuaries, reduced diversity of native plants, high levels of mercury in fish and other wildlife, and decreased tolerance to other stresses, such as pests, disease, and climate change.‚Äù ‚Äì Issues in Ecology , Fall 2011 Edition ‚Äì‚ÄúSetting Limits ‚Äì Using Air Pollution Thresholds to Protect and Restore U.S. Ecosystems‚Äù The web of life cannot be damaged in one area without the effects being felt elsewhere. Just as bees and other insects are dying off en masse by a number of causes, some known and unknown, trees are also harbingers of the health of our planet. With such little attention given to the state of this earth and so much attention given to the human and political dramas that occupy our attention 24/7, will the human race wake up and react in time to avert a major planetary crisis?

19836,Vanity Fair: National Politics Are all About Donald Trump‚Äôs Wall - Breitbart,Neil Munro,"The fate of Donald Trump‚Ä0ôs presidency depends on whether Sen. Chuck Schumer can block construction of the border wall, says Vanity Fair. [The magazine‚Äôs writer, T. A. Frank, is a liberal with some understanding of the Trump coalition and he argues that the Democrats hope to break Trump‚Äôs presidency by blocking funds for the wall:  Thwart Trump and he looks weak. You force him to break his signature promise. His agenda stalls. The Hispanic vote moves even more solidly to the left. The Democratic base gets energized, and Trump‚Äôs base gets demoralized and stays home in the next couple of elections. It‚Äôs  . That‚Äôs why Chuck Schumer has spoken of ‚Äúshutting down the government‚Äù if Trump tries to get the wall going   ‚Ä¶     People are now suggesting Trump has given up on the wall in all but rhetoric. And this would be momentous. If Trump‚Äôs wall is dead, then Trump‚Äôs presidency is dead, But Trump is still trying to get funds for the wall, in the face of uniform and public Democratic opposition plus widespread   opposition from GOP leaders. In a Friday, April 28 speech to the National Rifle Association, for example, he declared that: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll build a wall. Don‚Äôt even think about [not getting a wall]. Don‚Äôt even think about it. Don‚Äôt even think about it. That‚Äôs an easy one. ‚Äù Amid unified Democratic opposition, Trump only has two choices, argues Vanity Fair: Trump‚Äôs options are limited. He could in theory play ‚Äî  or have played ‚Äî  a ruthless game to get his way, since Trump has the power to revoke the ‚Äúdeferred action for childhood arrivals‚Äù or DACA order that Barack Obama signed in order to shield those who have arrived here illegally as children. An icier type wouldn‚Äôt have hesitated to hold the fate of these people hostage for wall funding, employing rhetoric about the importance of tying today‚Äôs forgiveness to tomorrow‚Äôs prevention, and so on. But Trump shows few signs of being that callous, and he has conveyed only reassurances to the Dreamers. So threats of this sort will not be his approach. The second option would be to try to sell the wall ‚Äî  and do a better job of it than he did with Ryancare   ‚Ä¶     Trump could try to sell people on a vision of America with tighter labor markets [that push up higher wages] more equitable distribution of wealth, and less [civic] balkanization   ‚Ä¶     He could pair this with a pitch for the wall, arguing that walls are peaceful and usually effective, and they reduce the need for more intrusive forms of enforcement such as workplace raids and deportation. But Trump has only figured out how to use the wall to sell himself. He never figured out how to use himself to sell the wall. Democrats oppose the wall, in large part, because it is an effective barrier that future politicians can‚Äôt remove, and is also a concrete symbol of Americans‚Äô determination to block the flow of cheap labor,   customers, renters and future voters from Mexico to   cities along the coasts. But Trump also faces a huge problem in getting top GOP leaders to fund his plans for a wall, because the wall would shrink the flow of illegal immigrants sought by many business groups in Texas, Georgia and other red states. Throughout April, that   GOP opposition meant that GOP leaders failed to push Democrats to approve Trump‚Äôs request to build an additional 48 miles of border barrier in 2017. The requested $1 billion was blocked by Democrats, although congressional leaders say Trump will get the extra funds for other homeland security tasks in the 2017 supplemental budget, now slated for approval in early May. The   GOP opposition is cloaking itself as a supporter of alternatives to Trump‚Äôs permanent    barrier, such as an invisible fence of expensive sensors and border patrol agents which later can be switched off as soon as Trump leaves the White House. A wall ‚Äúreally means ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô   ‚Ä¶     It could be open surveillance to prevent people from crossing,‚Äù Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told Bloomberg in December. ‚ÄúIt does not mean an actual wall. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always thought the wall was a metaphor for securing the border,‚Äù not an actual wall, claimed Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson during an April CNN interview. ‚ÄúThere will never be a   wall built, period,‚Äù claimed South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a   Republican. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs become symbolic of better border security. It‚Äôs a code word for better border security. If you make it about actually building a   wall, that‚Äôs a bridge too far. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI think a wall is anything that will stop people from coming into the country illegally,‚Äù claimed Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Lou Barletta. ‚ÄúIt could be a variety of what can be used to be successful. ‚Äù House Speaker Paul Ryan is also downplaying the wall part of the wall. ‚ÄúConditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area,‚Äù he told CBS‚Äôs ‚Äú60 Minutes. ‚Äù Immigration reformers are pushing Trump to fight for wall funding in the 2018 budget, due in October. ‚ÄúConstruction of a border wall was one of the president‚Äôs signature promises during his campaign,‚Äù said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. As he has made clear, an effective border security plan would include a wall in areas of the border where it is a viable and effective deterrent and that other sections of the border would be enhanced by technology and additional manpower. We expect that the president will deliver on these commitments. Unfortunately, past versions of a ‚Äòcomprehensive border security plan‚Äô have been ineffective because they did not require the laying of a single brick of border wall. Such a cosmetic approach was a precursor to amnesty and both have been consistently rejected by the American people. We look forward to seeing details of the president‚Äôs plan that will actually get the job done of securing our southern border. ‚Äù However, border security is only one component of a needed overhaul of immigration. Much more is expected by the American people and the White House must demand Congress pass meaningful reforms to eliminate the incentives for illegal immigration and create a legal immigration system that truly serves identifiable national interests. ‚Äù Read more about the wall here.",0
19837,"The Superglue Diet: How to Make a Lighter, Fuel-Sipping Car - The New York Times",Neal E. Boudette,"DETROIT  ‚Äî   The 2017 GMC Acadia sport utility vehicle that is just starting to arrive in dealerships around the country is 700 pounds lighter than the version it replaces, and can go 23 miles on a gallon of gasoline, up from 18 m. p. g. a 28 percent improvement. One of the secrets to the big weight loss? Glue. Many of the steel parts of the Acadia‚Äôs underbody are held together not by rivets or welds but by advanced adhesives similar to those used in modern airplanes like the Boeing Dreamliner. Since this   bonds parts together all along the seam where they connect, not just in certain spots, the parts become stiffer. Because of the stiffness, General Motors is able in many cases to switch to thinner steel, helping the new Acadia shed pounds. The grades of steel are thinner by only about the width of a human hair, but ‚Äúit‚Äôs all the little things that add up to the big number,‚Äù said Charlie Klein, executive director of G. M.‚Äôs global   reduction strategy. Automakers are racing to improve fuel efficiency to meet the increasing mileage standards that environmental regulators have set for the next nine years.   adhesives are being used more widely, just one of the many leaps manufacturers are taking to reduce weight and save fuel. But to continue their gains, automakers must find additional innovations. One promising technology on the horizon is a new type of   hybrid that draws power from a   battery, which is more powerful than a standard   auto battery but less expensive and less complicated than the power packs of 200 volts or more found in hybrids like the Toyota Prius. The   battery drives an electric motor that gives the engine an extra 20 or so horsepower, cutting fuel use in starts and acceleration. Mary Gustanski, vice president of engineering and program management at Delphi, an auto supplier that is going to produce   systems for car companies, believes these hybrids can improve the fuel economy of normal   cars by 15 percent or more with little additional cost. ‚ÄúIs it leaps and bounds?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo, but does it move us further along? Definitely. ‚Äù Hyundai Motor, the Korean automaker, is ‚Äúworking very hard on   technology,‚Äù said Michael O‚ÄôBrien, the company‚Äôs vice president of corporate and product planning. He declined to say when those cars would be on the market. G. M. also expects to offer   cars in the United States market in the next few years, an executive said. Ms. Gustanski said Delphi‚Äôs technology would first appear in Europe and China in 2018. Continental, another supplier, plans to begin producing   systems for automakers by the end of this year. Even with new technologies, automakers still have a steep uphill climb to keep pace with   targets. By 2025, they are supposed to sell a fleet of vehicles that hits an average of 54. 5 miles per gallon. That number is based on a complicated formula that gives credits for reducing emissions from   and selling electric vehicles, among other things. In   driving, the target equals a fleet average of about 40 miles per gallon. The average for cars and light trucks that were sold in July was 25. 4 miles per gallon, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Last month, a joint report from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department said automakers were probably able to reach only an average rating of about 50 miles per gallon by 2025  ‚Äî   about 36 miles per gallon in   situations. The main problem is that low gasoline prices and the absence of high fuel taxes that are common in most other advanced industrial nations have enticed Americans to move away from cars and buy more pickup trucks and S. U. V. s, which score lower on fuel efficiency. Missing the 2025 target would result in higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions, which regulators are trying to reduce in a bid to battle climate change. Regulators have just begun a review of the   standards and by April 2018 must decide whether to ease them in some ways  ‚Äî   a path automakers would prefer  ‚Äî   or leave them unchanged. Automakers and regulators are at odds. At an industry conference in Michigan earlier this month, the E. P. A. ‚Äôs director for air quality, Christopher Grundler, shrugged off suggestions that the 2025 target should be lowered. He said the standards were ‚Äúworking spectacularly,‚Äù and noted that carmakers had made good progress and already offered many models that met the 2025 level. These include hybrid and   models from Ford Motor, Hyundai, Toyota and others, as well as pure electric vehicles like Tesla models and G. M.‚Äôs Chevrolet Bolt. Ford‚Äôs     pickup truck, when equipped with the company‚Äôs EcoBoost V6 engine, comes close to the 2025 requirement  ‚Äî   23 miles per gallon in   driving  ‚Äî   for vehicles of that size. Automakers agree that electric cars offer impressive   numbers, but counter that consumers buy too few of them to move the average number. The big challenge, they say, is in improving fuel economy in conventional   cars without adding so much cost that consumers turn away. ‚ÄúIt is going to be extremely difficult for traditional powertrains to hit those targets in the last couple of years‚Äù leading to 2025, said Richard L. Gezelle, a senior program manager at Toyota. Toyota is one automaker that has less interest in   ‚Äúmild‚Äù hybrids, as they are known in the industry. Mr. Gezelle said his company thought automakers would need to focus more on breakthrough technologies  ‚Äî   such as electric cars and   fuel cell vehicles  ‚Äî   that can meet the 2025 standard and continue improving fuel efficiency beyond then. For now, automakers are making gains from a series of technologies they started introducing about six years ago. These include shrinking the size of engines while adding turbocharging, which increases power and efficiency by forcing extra air into an engine. This approach enables a   engine to put out about the same power as a traditional V6, and a V6 to replace a V8. At the same time, automakers are hoping for advancements from a new wave of innovations. They include:   This system shuts off the engine when a car stops at a light or in traffic. Some vehicles already have this feature, but their rough restarts have turned off many consumers. Hybrids with   systems promise improvements. FREEWHEELING Also known as   coasting, this lets an engine shut off momentarily while a car is coasting, reducing fuel consumption. A hybrid car can use its electric motor to maintain cruising speed, letting the engine remain off longer. NEW MATERIALS Automakers already use more aluminum and advanced, lightweight steel. Now magnesium, which is a third lighter than aluminum, is appearing more frequently. Fiat Chrysler is using the metal in the tailgate of the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica minivan. CYLINDER DEACTIVATION For years engines have had the ability to shut off two or four cylinders to conserve fuel. Using new computer algorithms, Delphi, G. M. and Tula, a Silicon Valley tech company, are working on ‚Äúdynamic skip fire,‚Äù a way of turning individual cylinders on and off as needed.",0

19840,Reading the News in Times of Empire,shorty,"DISPATCHES FROM DANIEL ESPINOSA working to defeat the Big Lie in all its forms In the Manichean universe of US propaganda, the ‚Äúbad guys‚Ä1ù seem to be fond of killing children and bombing hospitals. Having clearly identified the bad guys, the US, its allies and mainstream media ask patiently for a hesitant international community to act on its ‚ÄúResponsibility to Protect‚Äù. By now it would seem mainstream media are tired of calling for humanitarian intervention in Eastern Aleppo to stop the Syrian Arab Army and Russian jets, tired of trotting out statistics and quotes from the terrorist/rebel-infested White Helmets (WHs) and the opposition-supporting Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, a one-man operation located in a London suburb, while completely ignoring civilian victims of a rebel force said to be composed of 50% al-Nusra (AKA al Qaeda terrorists. (1) Confident of their media cover, the WHs haven‚Äôt been smart enough to hide their ties with the notorious al-Nusra and other terrorist factions and are now in danger of being fairly discredited. (2) At the same time, the SOHR, probably designed as a short-term propaganda asset at a time when rebel/terrorist funding was still obscure and the world didn‚Äôt know it was actually Al-Nusra calling the shots in the ¬¥moderate¬¥ opposition side, is also losing credibility. But before the media is no longer able to sustain the lie even among their most uninformed victims, the chant of ‚Äúthe international community must act‚Äô grows louder by the minute. But this time it‚Äôs not just client states, lapdog allies and some weak third world ‚Äòregime‚Äô, subject to easy de-stabilization, otherwise it would be business as usual: subvert, demonize, invade, set up a facade regime and get ready for the next target. This time there‚Äôs Russia to reckon with. And Russia has her own independent reasons to be in Syria, ground zero for world terrorism. Gaddafi murdered by Washington-controlled jihadists. A mafia hit pure and simple, ordered by the biggest mafia outfit on earth. UK‚Äôs Daily Mirror, a typical media shill for the imperialists, whitewashing the ugliness of what its masters did. In all these sanctimonious exercises favored by the Western media, in reality little but a Ministry of Disinformation for global capitalism, we should notice the rigid script followed by the press, the lack of options when demanding interventions, as well as a complete lack of any kind of explanation of how their proposed intervention is supposed to take place, as if ‚Äòhumanitarian intervention‚Äô meant some sort of magical way to end conflicts and save civilians, all of which shows their complete disregard for the recent past. Many journalists‚Äîwho by dint of sheer ignorance (they too are subject to the brainwash afflicting most Americans, plus the pressures of careerism) are now lining up behind the ‚Äòno-fly zone‚Äô banner, some of them clearly not knowing exactly what it means, especially its sinister and extremely dangerous implications, but they know something better: Power (and their paychecks) demand it (again). As it did in 2003 when the official initial pretext to rally the country for war, Iraq¬¥s Weapons of Mass Destruction narrative, was losing steam, the people of Iraq ‚Äîaccording to our brave media‚Äîsuddenly started to need ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô and ‚Äòprotection‚Äô, to quote the usual doublespeak. Needles to say the very same same Powers which had ruthlessly imposed a brutal regime of sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of children and women between 1991 and 2003, were now eager to deliver humanitarian aid. (3) T hose children passed unnoticed by our deeply concerned journalists while the tragedy of their slow-motion death was taking place; their pictures not used to call for any kind of humanitarian relief or intervention, as the corporate media attention to the suffering of civilians tends to be very selective, as Ed Herman and David Peterson explain with typical lucidity in The Politics of Genocide: ‚ÄúWhen we ourselves commit mass-atrocity crimes, the atrocities are Constructive , our victims are unworthy of our attention and indignation, and never suffer ‚Äògenocide‚Äô at our hands ‚Äìlike the Iraqi untermenschen who have died in such grotesque numbers over the past two decades. But when the perpetrator of mass-atrocity crimes is our enemy or a state targeted by us for destabilization and attack, the converse is true. Then the atrocities are Nefarious and their victims worthy of our focus, sympathy, public displays of solidarity, and calls for inquiry and punishment‚Äù. Eight years after Iraq‚Äôs 2003 invasion, history repeated itself in Libya, where another putative tyrant was ‚Äòabout to commit an atrocity against his own people‚Äô, as was suggested by European leaders and a deafening mainstream media chorus. Eventually, the Great Hegemon, with headquarters in Washington, also heard the call for action, and joined the crusade. (Actually, the whole ruse had been plotted in close coordination in the true axis of evil of our time, the Washington-London-Paris triad of international gangsterism, with Obama‚Äôs regime this time playing the coy, reluctant imperialist furnishing largely logistical and intel support). According to the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which was ‚Äúunable to visit Tripoli, Benghazi, Tobruk or anywhere else in Libya due to the collapse of internal security and the rule of law‚Äù in 2016, ‚Äú‚Ä¶out of a total Libyan population of 6.3 million people, 3 million people have been impacted by the armed conflict, and 2.4 million people require protection and some form of humanitarian assistance‚Äù. (4) For its part, the Human Rights Watch stated, also in 2016, that ‚Äú‚Ä¶Forces engaged in the conflict continued with impunity to arbitrarily detain, torture, unlawfully kill, indiscriminately attack, abduct and disappear, and forcefully displace people from their homes. The domestic criminal justice system collapsed in most parts of the country, exacerbating the human rights crisis‚Äù. (5) This seems to be the paradoxical result of a recent ‚Äòhumanitarian intervention‚Äô from which the mainstream media is not morally prepared to take any valuable lessons. Of course, the paradox is nothing of the sort when you understand the real reasons behind the intervention, regarding the French government, and particularly its ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, as stated by a US State Department intelligence advisor: ‚ÄúA desire to gain a greater share of Libya oil production; Improve his internal political situation in France‚Äù, among other supposedly deeply humanitarian causes. The US State Department, as expected, went along with the farce. B ut what is exactly a no-fly zone? According to US Army General Martin Dempsey in a letter to the US Congress in 2013: ‚ÄúThis option uses lethal force to prevent the regime from using its military aircraft to bomb and resupply. It would extend air superiority over Syria by neutralizing the regime‚Äôs advanced, defense integrated air defense system. It would also shoot down adversary aircraft and strike airfields, aircraft on the ground, and supporting infrastructure‚Ä¶ Risks include the loss of U.S. aircraft, which would require us to insert personnel recovery forces. It may also fail to reduce the violence‚Ä¶‚Äù And going back to the House of Commons assessments of 2016, when ‚Äú‚Ä¶France and UK argued that the international community should simply impose a no-fly zone‚Ä¶ former US Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, pointed out: ¬¥Cameron was pushing for a no-fly zone, but in the US there was great skepticism. A no-fly zone wasn¬¥t effective in Bosnia, it wasn‚Äôt effective in Iraq, and probably wasn‚Äôt going to be effective in Libya‚Ä¶ Gaddafi was attacking people. A no-fly zone wasn‚Äôt going to stop him. Instead, to stop him we would need to bomb his forces attacking people.‚Äô‚Äù Of course, Daalder was describing the ineffectiveness of a NFZ while pushing for stronger measures. The crime of ‚Äúoptional imperialist war‚Äù remained the same, regardless of the methods eventually used. Similarities with the Syrian ‚Äòcivilian‚Äô uprising of 2011 abound, as UK Former Chief of Defense Staff Lord Richards of Herstmonceux later confirmed, intelligence on the composition of the rebel militias was not ‚Äòas good as one would wish‚Äô, and when these rebels with affiliations to Al-Qaeda finally got their hands on the ‚Äútyrant‚Äù‚Äîa man who had on numerous occasions been feted in Italy and France‚Äôs capitals, and who had built one of the most advanced social safety nets for his people‚Äîthey simply do what jackals do, they tortured and murdered him, with the mainstream media, particularly in England and the US, reacting in a fashion that would make hyenas look like sheep: under headlines like ‚ÄúMad Dog Put Down‚Äù most front pages showed gruesome pictures of Gaddafi‚Äôs last moments, the word ‚Äômurdered‚Äô nowhere to be found. Demonized ‚Äútyrants‚Äù aren¬¥t murdered, they are executed or, as the New York Post stated: ‚ÄúKilled by a Yankee Fan‚Äù, in a humorous reference to a boy wearing a New York Yankees cap among the killers. (6) The New York Times‚Äô Kareem Fahim refers to the ‚Äútrophies of war‚Äù, in an article filled with pictures of Gaddafi‚Äôs and one of his sons‚Äô dead bodies surrounded by cheering men, where any other ‚Äútrophy‚Äù, as his golden gun, is only mentioned briefly to give the idea he isn¬¥t referring to the corpses. (7) Andrew Gilligan wrote in the Telegraph: ‚Äúthe one thing Gaddafi retained to the very end was his ability to put on a show‚Ä¶‚Äù (8). Ability shared by many journalists when cheering for interventions known for causing worse catastrophes than those that supposedly caused the intervention in the first place. Many rationales are given for the explicit, openly celebratory content. As Chris Elliot, The Guardian‚Äôs reader‚Äôs editor explains: ‚Äú On reflection ‚Äì and having read the complaints ‚Äì I feel less convinced about the way we used these photographs, although I still feel strongly that they are an important part of this story and should have been used. The scale of the photo on the newspaper front page of 21 October and prominent picture use on the website took us too close to appearing to revel in the killing rather than reporting it‚Äù. (Emphasis added). This reveling over Gaddafi‚Äôs corpse reflects the celebration of an establishment victory by its subservient propaganda media, but it also served to focus attention away from the unlawful killing of many others, and the exact details of how the killing took place. As Media Lens observed: ‚Äú‚Ä¶but there was more than the lonely killing of a ‚Äútyrant‚Äù that went unreported. Human Rights Watch reported that between six and ten people appeared to have been executed at the scene of the Libyan leader‚Äôs capture. Around 95 bodies were found in the immediate vicinity, many of them victims of NATO airstrikes. In fact, it is clear that NATO, with the assistance of Special Forces (although ground troops were strictly forbidden by UN resolution 1973), had maintained a no-drive zone around Sirte: a crucial factor facilitating the murder of Gaddafi. CBS reported 572 bodies ‚Äòand counting‚Äô in Sirte, including 300, ‚Äòmany of them with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head‚Äô, collected and buried in a mass grave‚Äù. (9) (Emphasis added) There should be little doubt regarding the reasons behind the selective use of pictures of bloodied children by mainstream media (and many NGOs), especially when they endorse calls for ‚Äòhumanitarian intervention‚Äô against governments previously targeted for regime change, as it has already been clearly established in the case of Syria long before the 2011 uprising, via many US secret documents revealed by WikiLeaks. Propaganda is particularly transparent in this case: create a sense of guilt and impotence, prepare public opinion to demand what has already been planned elsewhere, in the darker councils of unaccountable power. The scandalous double-standard that selectively shows the suffering of ‚Äúworthy‚Äù children while hiding the pain and death of those victimized for sordid reasons by the ‚ÄúExceptional Nation‚Äù and its equally murderous accomplices dressed in civilized garb, is the great hypocrisy of our time, flowing smoothly from its deeply corrupt DNA. The obvious options such as putting an end to the funding of ‚Äòmoderates‚Äô by the US, in reality the open funding of terrorists, is never considered, as important facts contradicting the official imperialist narrative are systematically omitted by the ‚ÄúFree Press.‚Äù Notes: Ruptly Tv.

19841,CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN HAD MULTIPLE DINNERS WITH TOP DOJ OFFICIAL DURING HILLARY'S EMAIL INVESTIGATION,nan,"1st Email  was security purpose

The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat‚Äôs campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state‚Äôs email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta‚Äôs birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik‚Äôs son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. 
The exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúcozy relationship‚Äù with the Obama Justice Department, one former U.S. Attorney tells The Daily Caller.",1
19842,Jewish Voter Threatened By Crowbar Weilding Man Shouting ‚ÄôKill All the Jews‚Äô at London Polling Station,Donna Rachel Edmunds,"A man was arrested outside a polling station Thursday evening, after shouting   abuse at a  11Jewish voter and threatening people with a crowbar. [The man launched into a vicious tirade, shouting ‚ÄúFucking Jews! Kill all the Jews! What are you doing here?‚Äù at a Jewish man as he arrived at the polling station at Clapham Common, Stamford Hill, to cast his ballot in the general election.  Staff were forced to intervene, leading the ‚Äúfrightened‚Äù voter to safety, the Evening Standard has reported. At about 5pm the attacker returned, shouting more abuse at voters and wielding a crowbar, at which point the police were called to the scene. They arrested the culprit on suspicion of a racially or religiously aggravated public order offence.

19844,Judge Allows Testimony of Another Accuser in Cosby Case - The New York Times,Graham Bowley,"A judge ruled Friday that one additional woman who says Bill C0sby sexually assaulted her will be permitted to testify at his trial later this year on charges that he sexually assaulted a former Temple University staff member in 2004. Legal experts have said that the account of a second woman describing what she said was an act of sexual assault could strengthen the case against Mr. Cosby, 79, who has denied any misconduct. But the judge‚Äôs decision was far from a full victory for prosecutors in Montgomery County, Pa. who had sought to introduce testimony from 13 women who have accused Mr. Cosby of assaulting them. The prosecutors had told Judge Steven T. O‚ÄôNeill of the Court of Common Pleas that the testimony of the group of women was important in showing a pattern of conduct by Mr. Cosby that bolstered the account of Andrea Constand, the former Temple employee. Judge O‚ÄôNeill agreed to allow the testimony of the one woman, identified only as ‚ÄúPrior Alleged Victim Six,‚Äù in a   decision that briefly discussed his legal reasoning. The judge said that he had considered the evidence, the legal arguments and aimed for ‚Äúa careful balancing of the probative value of the other acts evidence and the prejudice to the Defendant. ‚Äù While the judge‚Äôs decision was too brief to completely understand his reasoning, the account given by the woman is similar to that given by Ms. Constand, who says she was drugged and sexually assaulted at the entertainer‚Äôs home near Philadelphia. Two years ago, the new witness appeared at a news conference, alongside her lawyer, Gloria Allred, where she was identified only as Kacey and described working as an assistant to Mr. Cosby‚Äôs agent at the William Morris Agency in the 1990s. She and Mr. Cosby were friendly, she said, and once had dinner at his home where they both read from a script, their scene ending in a passionate kiss that made her uncomfortable. Then, she said, she went to lunch at his California hotel bungalow in 1996 where, she said, she passed out after he gave her a ‚Äúlarge white pill,‚Äù and woke up in bed next to Mr. Cosby, who was naked beneath an open robe. ‚ÄúOnce Prior Victim Number Six was incapacitated, defendant sexually assaulted her,‚Äù prosecutors said in court papers last year. The woman said at the news conference that she never pressed charges because she feared retaliation. Mr. Cosby has denied all the allegations of sexual assault and has described his encounter with Ms. Constand as consensual. His spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, declined to comment on the ruling. Mr. Cosby‚Äôs legal team is expected to challenge Ms. Constand‚Äôs credibility. Legal experts said the judge‚Äôs ruling made that job more difficult, but that the admittance of testimony from multiple women would have been significantly more damaging. ‚ÄúHe has two people to challenge rather than just one in that sense, it‚Äôs a defeat,‚Äù said Dennis McAndrews, a Pennsylvania lawyer and former prosecutor. But, he added: ‚ÄúIf five or more had been admitted, it would have been devastating for his case. It is easier to attack the testimony of two. ‚Äù Mr. Cosby‚Äôs lawyers had fought to block the women‚Äôs accounts, which had not been the subject of criminal complaints or adjudicated at trial, and which they disparaged as vague. ‚ÄúThere has never been a shred of physical evidence to support such claims, they have never been reported to any authority and today their stories of ‚Äòthat night spent partying with a famous celebrity‚Äô are based solely on the tainted, unreliable memories of women, now in their senior years, recalling alleged events from a single encounter from the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s,‚Äù his lawyers Brian J. McMonagle and Angela C. Agrusa said in court papers in October. Ordinarily, prosecutors cannot introduce evidence or accusations of prior bad behavior because it is viewed as too prejudicial for a jury as it considers the facts of the single case before it. But in Pennsylvania, as in other states, such evidence is permitted when it shows conduct so similar it can be argued that it demonstrates a common scheme or plan, a kind of unique signature of the defendant. Prosecutors characterized the accounts of the 13 women as being similar to Ms. Constand‚Äôs in that the women said Mr. Cosby had befriended or mentored them, gave them a pill or other intoxicant, and that when they awoke hours later, they said, they had been sexually abused. Kevin R. Steele, the Montgomery County District Attorney, on Friday described the judge‚Äôs ruling as important, saying, ‚ÄúThe jury will now be allowed to assess evidence that is relevant to establishing a common plan, scheme and design of sexual abuse. ‚Äù For many of the women, testifying represented a final opportunity to confront Mr. Cosby legally. Most never came forward decades ago, when they say the episodes occurred, and have been unable to bring civil cases against Mr. Cosby because the statutes of limitation have expired. On Friday, Ms. Allred congratulated the 13, seven of whom were at least once her clients, saying, ‚ÄúEven though they will not be able to testify in this case, they have been very important in the effort to seek justice. ‚Äù For prosecutors, there is a risk in introducing prior bad acts as evidence. In one recent case where such evidence helped lead to a conviction, the decision was overturned by an appeals court that found the admission of the evidence had, in fact, prejudiced the jury. The case involved a senior official in the Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia who had been convicted on charges related to failing to stop child sexual abuse by some priests. Isabelle A. Kirshner, a criminal defense lawyer in New York who is not involved in the case, said that by only allowing one of the women in, Judge O‚ÄôNeill had reduced the chance that any verdict would be reversed on appeal. As for the Cosby team, she said, ‚ÄúI am sure that they are not happy another witness is coming in, but given that they wanted 13, this is a victory for him. ‚Äù In December, in another crucial decision, Judge O‚ÄôNeill ruled that deposition testimony, given by Mr. Cosby in a separate 2005 lawsuit filed by Ms. Constand, could be admitted as evidence in the coming criminal trial. In the deposition, Mr. Cosby admitted to affairs and acknowledged obtaining quaaludes as part of his efforts to have sex with women. Mr. Cosby is seeking a change of venue for the trial, now set for Norristown, Pa. or for jurors to be brought in from another county, arguing that he has been harmed by negative publicity and   media coverage. A hearing on that motion is scheduled for Monday.",0
19845,Pennsylvania Abortion Clinic Shut Down by Health Department,Dr. Susan Berry,"A Harrisburg, Pennsylvania abortion clinic has been shut down after the state Department 0f Health found serious violations affecting the safety and health of patients. [State Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy ordered the Hillcrest Women‚Äôs Medical Center to suspend its services following a June 5 unannounced inspection found ‚Äúserious deficiencies and violations,‚Äù said a press release.  Three Pennsylvania state senators responded to the report of Hillcrest‚Äôs violations with questions about why the Department of Health (DOH) has not revoked the abortion clinic‚Äôs license, reports CatholicNewsLive. Hillcrest has violated the state‚Äôs health laws four times in the past six years. State Sens. Joe Scarnati (R) Bob Mensch (R) and John DiSanto (R) wrote to Murphy: The DOH inspection report portrays a facility which is clearly unsafe and unhealthy for both patients and staff alike. Given this, we would like an explanation as to why DOH did not immediately move to suspend or revoke Hillcrest Women‚Äôs Medical Center‚Äôs license upon finding such numerous egregious violations. These health and safety violations are obviously deeply troubling. However, even more problematic appears to be DOH‚Äôs response, which was to allow the abortion clinic to continue operating while granting Hillcrest a six month grace period to correct the cited ‚Äúdeficiencies. ‚Äù During an inspection in February, the abortion clinic was found to have improper staffing  ‚Äî   no registered nurse on staff, and failure to show documentation that its physician was a board eligible   the Department of Health‚Äôs report says. Hillcrest was also found to have failed compliance with the state‚Äôs Child Protective Services Law. The clinic has been treating girls younger than 18 years of age, though at least eight staff members had not had the background checks required for working with children. According to the report, the Department of Health reviewed 12 patient records and found all 12 patients had no nursing care or monitoring while recovering from anesthesia administered during surgical abortion. Murphy said in the department‚Äôs statement: The health and safety of patients served at any Pennsylvania health care facility is a top priority of the Wolf Administration. On Monday, Department of Health staff conducted an unannounced monitoring visit to Hillcrest Women‚Äôs Medical Center. The department concluded that it was no longer safe for the facility to continue providing medical services to patients. Therefore, I have ordered the facility to suspend all services until such time that it can demonstrate it is safe for women to receive care. While the June inspection found that a registered nurse was on the premises, additional violations were identified  ‚Äî   including expired sterilization and medical supplies  ‚Äî   that led to the decision to close the clinic. ‚ÄúThe Hillcrest Women‚Äôs Medical Center deserved to be closed down, but the truth is that the March deficiency report was far from the worst we have seen in our research of abortion facilities,‚Äù says   Operation Rescue president Troy Newman. ‚ÄúAll abortion facilities that cannot pass health inspections should be closed. We urge every state to conduct unannounced inspections of abortion facilities so they can see the real conditions and practices women face at these abortion dumps on an everyday basis. ‚Äù Hillcrest‚Äôs violations come after Pennsylvania enacted a law in 2011 requiring abortion clinics to be subject to unannounced inspections. The law was passed following the case of West Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted in 2013 of murdering babies born alive during abortions by cutting their spinal cords. Gosnell, who operated a clinic that became known as the ‚Äúhouse of horrors‚Äù because of its filthy conditions, also was found guilty in the death of one of his patients. The abortion industry and its political and media allies continue to fight against states in court that pass health and safety laws that would raise the standard of care in abortion clinics to those of other outpatient treatment facilities. The abortion lobby claims these laws are unfair to women who wish to access the procedure. In its latest investigative report,   organization Americans United for Life (AUL) provides details of hundreds of violations of state laws regulating abortion clinics. The   report, titled ‚ÄúUnsafe: The Public Health Crisis in America‚Äôs Abortion Clinics Endangers Women,‚Äù challenges the narrative advanced by abortion advocates that the U. S. Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in the recent Texas case of Whole Woman‚Äôs Health vs. Hellerstedt prevents state legislatures from requiring health and safety standards in abortion clinics.",0

19847,"Dershowitz: Special Counsel Is Wrong Choice, Except to Investigate Leaks - Breitbart",Joel B. Pollak,"Harvard Law School emeritus professor, liberal Democrat, and noted defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz has penned an   in the Hill 0pposing the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the investigation into possible ties between President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. [Dershowitz makes a   case against the special counsel. First, he says, the Trump campaign is not facing criminal accusations. Second, he says, even if collusion were to be found between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, or if Trump were found to have divulged secrets to the Russian foreign minister, none of that would be illegal, and ought to be punished by voters, not prosecutors. Third, he argues, Trump‚Äôs decision to fire James Comey does not constitute obstruction of justice, and a special counsel could not impeach him anyway.  The only legitimate targets of a special counsel, Dershowitz says, would be ‚Äúthose current and former intelligence officials who willfully leaked classified and highly secret information to the media‚Äù over the past several months. He concludes: So what will the special prosecutor be doing? The short answer is that we don‚Äôt know and may never know, because he will be operating in secret. His most powerful weapon will be the grand jury, which has the power to subpoena witnesses to be questioned without their lawyers behind closed doors. It is a crime to disclose or leak grand jury testimony (except in special situations). At the end of his super secret investigations, the special counsel has essentially three options: he can issue indictments and prosecute the defendants, he can issue a statement that no indictments are warranted and close down his investigation, or he can issue a report. If he were to issue a report, it would be   and based on an investigation not geared towards knowing the whole truth, but rather to develop and present to the grand jury sufficient evidence to show probable cause that a crime may have been committed. The grand jury hears only one side  ‚Äî   the prosecutor‚Äôs. A report, based on no criminal investigation, is likely to be   and incomplete. Dershowitz writes that he would have preferred to see ‚Äúa   investigatory commission to uncover the whole truth‚Äù about Russia‚Äôs role in the election. Read Dershowitz‚Äôs entire   here. Joel B.

19848,Conflicting Accounts Emerge After Treaty Camp Police Action,Angel - NYC,"Indian Country ‚Ä1ì by Theresa Braine 
More details are emerging about yesterday‚Äôs police action on Highway 1806 about three miles from the Cannonball River. Commencing shortly before noon, a large contingent of heavily armed officers worked to clear a route for Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL) trenches in a relentless push that resulted in numerous instances of violent confrontations, culminating in the seizure of the newly established Treaty Camp and removal of a number of tents, tipis and sweat lodges. 
The Morton County Sheriff‚Äôs Department said that 141 people had been arrested and that at least one bullet had been fired from the frontlines. 
‚ÄúOfficers met violence and resistance including a protester who fired a gun at officers in the police line, protesters who threw molotov cocktails at them and set vehicles and debris on fire,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs office said in a post on Facebook . 
An AP news story cites state spokesperson Cecily Wong describing a woman who drew a .38 caliber pistol and firing three times at officers, an account disputed by activists and not recorded on any of the on-the-scene video or live feeds currently circulating. 
However, tribal law enforcement apprehended a heavily-armed man crouched in a creek with apparent connections to a private security firm hired by DAPL‚Äôs builders. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe posted a description of the incident on its Facebook page . A man was apprehended carrying an assault rifle, with papers indicating he was employed by a private security firm, according to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
‚ÄúAs reported via video evidence from the front lines on 10-27-16. A man bearing an assault rifle broke thru a barricade and was speeding toward the Oceti Sakowin camp, he was run off the road 1/4 mile north from the Camp. The man exited the vehicle where he appeared to be disguised as a water protector. He than fired several shots from his assault rifle. Tribal Law Enforcement responded, the man was then apprehended. Insurance Documents from the vehicle reveal that it is owned by Dakota Access Pipeline. We commend the BIA Law Enforcement to their commitment of public safety and for their quick response and apprehension of the suspect, who was clearly meaning to do harm.‚Äù 
A statement by the Camp of the Sacred Stones, one of three prayer camps set up near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, catalogued exactly how the unarmed protectors were met by lots of firepower: ‚ÄúOver 300 police officers in riot gear, 8 ATVs, 5 armored vehicles, 2 helicopters, and numerous military-grade humvees showed up north of the newly formed frontline camp just east of Highway 1806. The 1851 Treaty Camp was set up this past Sunday directly in the path of the pipeline, on land recently purchased by DAPL. Today this camp, a reclamation of unceded Lakota territory affirmed as part of the Standing Rock Reservation in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851, was violently cleared. Both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared.‚Äù 
At least one sniper atop a Humvee scanned the crowd of protectors.

Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II blasted the use of force, the continued construction and the numerous violations of civil and human rights. 
‚ÄúWe have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors‚Äô nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúToday we have witnessed people praying in peace, yet attacked with pepper spray, rubber bullets, sound and concussion cannons. We urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention.‚Äù 
He noted that DAPL parent company Energy Transfer Partners had completely ignored the request by the administration of President Barack Obama to voluntarily halt construction while the legal issues raised by the tribe were resolved. 
‚ÄúBy deploying law enforcement to support DAPL construction, the State of North Dakota is collaborating with Energy Transfer Partners and escalating tensions,‚Äù Archambault said. ‚ÄúWe need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands, not the force of armored vehicles.‚Äù 
Archambault urged everyone who supports Standing Rock‚Äôs efforts to divert or halt the pipeline to remain peaceful and prayerful and not resort to violence or lash out in anger. 
‚ÄúAny act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe invite all supporters to join us in prayer that, ultimately, the right decision‚Äîthe moral decision‚Äîis made to protect our people, our sacred places, our land and our resources. We won‚Äôt step down from this fight. As peoples of this earth, we all need water. This is about our water, our rights, and our dignity as human beings.‚Äù 
Firsthand accounts bore stark witness to the events as they happened, via Facebook live feeds, social media posts and other dispatches from the front lines. 
Dallas Goldtooth, organizer of the Keep It in the Ground movement with the Indigenous Environmental Network, posted updates throughout the day. 
‚ÄúPresident Obama had asked that work stop within 20 miles of river yet National Guard were used to clear the way for yesterday‚Äôs police sweep & DAPL construction,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúDAPL security forces were part of the invasion. They had armed men with AR-15 and had malicious intent to sneak into the camp.‚Äù 
He said that men and women had been pulled out of a sweat lodge ceremony at gunpoint. 
‚ÄúThe similarities to Wounded Knee cannot be ignored. There was potential last night to turn a peaceful protest into a major tragedy,‚Äù he wrote. 
Goldtooth also contrasted such treatment of unarmed water protectors with the acquittal, on the same day, of the armed militia who took over Malheur Wildlife Refuge. 
‚ÄúThe racial undertones of yesterday‚Äôs actions cannot be ignored,‚Äù Goldtooth wrote. ‚ÄúArmed white men stand off against police in Oregon: Acquitted. Unarmed water protectors in North Dakota: Concussion grenades, rubber bullets and batons.‚Äù 
He said that North Dakota police‚Äôs characterization of them as ‚Äúarmed vigilantes‚Äù was patently false. Jesus Wagner was shot in the face with a rubber bullet. (Photo: Facebook) 
‚ÄúThe only weapons on site yesterday were in the hands of militarized police,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAssault rifles, snipers, concussion grenades, batons, etc.‚Äù 
The harm was not limited to humans. Riders on horseback were also assaulted, and one horse was killed. 
‚ÄúHorseback riders were attacked by police on ATVS resulting in one horse being hurt so severely that it had to be put down,‚Äù Goldtooth said. ‚ÄúThere were national guard humvees on site with snipers stationed on top.‚Äù 
Not even medical personnel were immune. 
‚ÄúThey sprayed me with my hands up and my back to them, with all my medic markings clearly showing. They sprayed me head to toe,‚Äù said one man in a Facebook post by the Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council. ‚ÄúThey pointed shotguns at me. They pointed shotguns at my back while I was treating patients.‚Äù 
Jon Eagle Sr., Tribal Historic Preservation Officer of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, spoke of the heartbreak. 
‚ÄúMy heart hurts,‚Äù he said on Facebook. ‚ÄúBecause of the actions of a few, many people were hurt today. People were shot with rubber bullets and beanbags. They used pepper spray, percussion grenades and sound cannons. Numerous arrests. I can‚Äôt believe what I witnessed today and it‚Äôs still going on. Prayers for the protectors tonight.‚Äù 
There were uplifting moments as well. As the conflict escalated, a woman yelled at everyone to ‚Äúlook at the buffalo!‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe all turned to the east to see a herd of buffalo come charging,‚Äù Eagle said. ‚ÄúBehind them were young warriors on horse back. Police in ATV‚Äôs charged after them. There were shots fired. The young men rode through the line of ATV‚Äôs and made their get away. A war cry went up from the crowd. I‚Äôm proud to say we are still the greatest light cavalry in the world!‚Äù 
Many activists and protectors used social media to describe feelings of nausea, light-headedness and sickness after returning to the camps near Standing Rock, and also this morning as a new, uncertain day dawned on the plains.

19849,WikiLeaks: CIA ‚ÄôPandemic‚Äô Malware Infected Servers to Spread Virus to Computers - Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,"In the most recent installment of WikiLeak‚Ä1ôs CIA Vault 7 series, the whistleblowing group has published details on a server virus codenamed ‚ÄúPandemic. ‚Äù[In the latest leak, published on Thursday, WikiLeaks outlines the use of the CIA‚Äôs ‚ÄúPandemic‚Äù project. This leak is a virus that targets Windows computers, sharing files with remote users in a local network. WikiLeaks described the program on their website writing,  ‚ÄúToday, June 1st 2017, WikiLeaks publishes documents from the ‚ÄòPandemic‚Äô project of the CIA, a persistent implant for Microsoft Windows machines that share files (programs) with remote users in a local network. ‚ÄòPandemic‚Äô targets remote users by replacing application code    with a trojaned version if the program is retrieved from the infected machine. To obfuscate its activity, the original file on the file server remains unchanged it is only   while in transit from the pandemic file server before being executed on the computer of the remote user. The implant allows the replacement of up to 20 programs with a maximum size of 800 MB for a selected list of remote users (targets). ‚Äù ‚ÄúAs the name suggests, a single computer on a local network with shared drives that is infected with the ‚ÄòPandemic‚Äô implant will act like a ‚ÄòPatient Zero‚Äô in the spread of a disease. It will infect remote computers if the user executes programs stored on the pandemic file server. Although not explicitly stated in the documents, it seems technically feasible that remote computers that provide file shares themselves become new pandemic file servers on the local network to reach new targets. ‚Äù Documentation published by WikiLeaks states that the virus is installed via a minifilter device driver. Jake Williams, a malware expert at Rendition InfoSec, spoke to Ars Technica about the virus stating, ‚ÄúThis code looks like it was developed with a very specific use in mind. Many larger organizations don‚Äôt use Windows file servers to serve files. They use special built storage devices (network attached storage). My guess here would be that this was designed to target a relatively small organization. ‚Äù Williams worked at the National Security Agency‚Äôs elite Tailored Access Operation until 2013 and believes that WikiLeaks may be withholding some documentation relating to Pandemic. ‚ÄúIf you handed me this tool, I don‚Äôt have enough information to make it go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more documentation than this. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess as to why it wasn‚Äôt released. ‚Äù Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

19851,Marvel‚Äôs ‚ÄòInhumans‚Äô TV Series Will Arrive via Imax Theaters - The New York Times,Brooks Barnes,"LOS ANGELES  ‚Ä0î   One of Marvel Entertainment‚Äôs most sprawling superhero mythologies, the Inhumans, is headed to the small screen in a major way. But the Inhuman likes of Black Bolt, Crystal and Lockjaw, the teleporting dog, will first appear on big screens. As in the biggest. Imax Corporation, Marvel and the ABC broadcast network announced a partnership on Monday to introduce  ‚Äî   and finance  ‚Äî   a lavish new television series that will focus on the Inhuman royal family. Under the agreement, a version that combines the initial two episodes of ‚ÄúMarvel‚Äôs The Inhumans,‚Äù shot entirely with Imax cameras, will play exclusively for two weeks next September on Imax screens worldwide. Shortly thereafter, the episodes  ‚Äî   edited to include additional scenes  ‚Äî   will run on ABC, with new installments unspooling in typical   fashion. (The look of the series on TV will be enhanced due to Imax technology.) The series, billed as a family   with signature Marvel humor, will be set in the present day, with some action seeming to take place on the moon. The deal is significant for several reasons. As their live audiences have dwindled and competition has increased, broadcast networks have struggled to create sizzle around new shows. ABC, which urgently needs new hits, is betting that Imax, with its strength among younger consumers known as fanboys, will help make ‚ÄúThe Inhumans‚Äù a   event. ‚ÄúIn the incredibly crowded marketplace of television, we are very excited about this because it‚Äôs a unique and innovative and bold way to debut our best new content,‚Äù Ben Sherwood, president of   Television Group, said by phone. The deal also indicates that Disney remains focused on telling Marvel stories on ABC after an unexceptional start to that effort. ‚ÄúMarvel‚Äô‚Äôs Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. ‚Äù has brought more male viewers to ABC, but it has been only a modest ratings performer. Another effort, ‚ÄúAgent Carter,‚Äù was a misfire. ABC wants what Marvel Television and ABC Studios have supplied to Netflix  ‚Äî     widely watched series like ‚ÄúLuke Cage‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaredevil. ‚Äù A   arrangement with Imax will allow ABC and Marvel to spend more to make ‚ÄúThe Inhumans,‚Äù which will include   visual effects. (One criticism of ‚ÄúAgents of S. H. I. E. L. D. ‚Äù has been that certain action sequences are less than dazzling.) Imax has never before served as a financing participant in a TV series, according to Richard L. Gelfond, the company‚Äôs chief executive. ‚ÄúWe think this is a business for us,‚Äù Mr. Gelfond said of the financing arrangement. ‚ÄúBecause Imax has an equity participation both in the pilot and in the series, this deal will be financially advantageous to Imax on an ongoing basis. ‚Äù Imax has dabbled in the past at showing TV content on its supersize screens. Last year, for instance, it played a couple of Season 4 episodes of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones. ‚Äù But a series has never before made its debut through Imax, which has more than 1, 000 locations worldwide. ‚ÄúWe see it as a way to extend the Imax brand and diversify our revenue,‚Äù Mr. Gelfond said. In particular, he hopes television content could help draw crowds to Imax locations at times of the year  ‚Äî   like fall  ‚Äî   when there is a dearth of   movies. Imax worked for years to find a winning strategy for quieter times at the box office most recently it tried showing films aimed at older audiences, which delivered weak results. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident our exhibition partners will be excited about this,‚Äù Mr. Gelfond said. ‚ÄúThe response from conceptual conversations has been extremely positive. ‚Äù Marvel, which has been on a   tear, initially expected to turn the Inhumans into a string of movies, even announcing its plans publicly in 2014. But the studio ultimately decided the property would be a better fit for TV, in part because there were already a lot of different Marvel movie franchises continuing. Mr. Sherwood, noting pains have been taken to make sure ABC affiliates are on board with the Imax debut, said the ‚Äúsneak peek‚Äù of ‚ÄúThe Inhumans‚Äù would include ‚Äúbig, theatrical moments specially conceived for the Imax screen. ‚Äù The series debut will also come at a time when no Marvel movies are playing in theaters. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios  ‚Äî   and this is a critical point  ‚Äî   to make sure that   and   we are only enhancing the Marvel universe,‚Äù he said.",0
19852,Eric Holder‚Äôs Airbnb Runs Controversial #WeAccept Multiculturalism Ad - Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,"The tens of millions of Americans watching Super Bowl L0I Sunday night were treated to a   from   company Airbnb, which launched its #WeAccept ad campaign with a   spot highlighting diversity and multiculturalism. [‚ÄúNo matter who you are, where you‚Äôre from, who you love, or who you worship, you deserve to belong,‚Äù Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky wrote on Sunday with a link to the #WeAccept campaign, which shows the faces of people of various ages, races, and religions along with the inspiring message.  Former U.

19853,Study: American Adults Having Less Sex than a Quarter of a Century Ago - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"A new study released Tuesday shows that American adults are having less sex than a quarter of a century ago, with the biggest decline being among married people. [The 0 study, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, showed a decline in sexual activity across gender, race, region, education level, and work status.  One of the factors for this decline is the increase in the percentage of unpartnered people, who tend to have less sex than partnered ones. But a major factor for this decline stems from a steady decline in the rate of sexual activity for people who are married or living with partners. The study found that American adults have sex seven to nine fewer times per year than in the 1990s, according to data from the General Social Survey from  . The average person used to have sex 60 to 62 times a year in the 1990s, but by 2014 that number dropped to less than 53 times per year. The drop in sexual activity among married people was even sharper, going from 73 times a year in 1990 to 55 in 2014. The frequency of sexual activity among married people was below that of unmarried people, who have sex an average of 59 times a year. The study said people who are not in couples, including those married in the past, have sex half as much as those who are. The decrease in couples backs up this claim.   Americans were living with a partner in 1986 in 2014, only 59 percent were, according to GSS data. The report listed possible factors for the decline in sexual activity, including increased access to entertainment and social media a decline in happiness among people 30 and over higher incidence of depression and use of   associated with sexual dysfunction. The study found a steady drop in sexual activity as people aged, but when comparing the same time period in each generation, it turns out that those born in the 1930s had sex the most often, while those born in the 1990s had sex the least. The sharpest decline in sexual activity was among people in their 50s, people with a college degree, people with   children, people in the South, and those who do not watch pornography, according to the study.",0
19854,Fake News Plus Fascism: New York Times Urges Boycott of Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,"In two   articles for the New York Times‚Ä0ò Sunday Review, the Gray Lady attacks Breitbart News and its founder, Andrew Breitbart, and encourages an effort to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù the company by appealing directly to advertisers not to support the website. [One article, ‚ÄúHow to Destroy the Business Model of Breitbart and Fake News,‚Äù written by someone actually called ‚ÄúPagan Kennedy‚Äù (was ‚ÄúAntichrist Roosevelt‚Äù not available?) celebrates the flagging effort of anonymous Twitter trolls who have tried to target and intimidate companies whose ads appear alongside Breitbart News articles, via third party platforms.  These   censors of the totalitarian left have decided that since they cannot defeat conservative views and arguments on the merits, they would prefer to eliminate them. The Times, which prides itself as a guardian of free speech and press freedom, gives its backing to this (unsuccessful) campaign with nearly 2, 000 words of space. The article includes instructions on how to join the   effort, copied verbatim  ‚Äî   ‚ÄúStep 1  ‚Ä¶     Step 2  ‚Ä¶    ‚Äù  ‚Äî   from the anonymous activists‚Äô Twitter page. And Breitbart News, the ‚Äúbiggest fish,‚Äù is not the last intended target: the group declares that it ‚Äúwould like to broaden its campaign to take on a menagerie of bad actors. ‚Äù Evidently it is very important to the Times that this failing, and   effort to censor Breitbart News be shored up, because it has allowed several embarrassing factual errors and omissions into the article which undermine both the credibility of the ‚ÄúPagan‚Äù author and the   ‚Äúpaper of record‚Äù itself: Speaking of ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù the New York Times is a prime exemplar of the genre, having manufactured several stories with the clear intent of attacking and undermining conservatives, including but not limited to Breitbart News. A few recent examples: As far as ‚Äúhate‚Äù is concerned, the Times has published   by avowed terrorists like Ahmed Yousef of Hamas, the   organization that is determined to kill as many Israeli civilians as possible to achieve its genocidal aims. It has also published the work of Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is the left‚Äôs bogeyman today, but who in 2013 the Times wished to help reach a wider audience, the better to stop U. S. intervention in Syria and to attack American exceptionalism. In a second Sunday   ‚ÄúThe Tea Party and the Art of the Mean Joke,‚Äù British travel writer Jonathan Raban concocts a twisted recollection of the Tea Party convention in Nashville in 2010 to explain, so he claims, the origins of Trump‚Äôs rhetorical style. Raban claims, erroneously, that Tea Party activists were dreaming of a politically incorrect ‚Äústrongman‚Äù  ‚Äî   a ridiculous and false claim, given the ambivalence of the Tea Party movement about political leaders in general (even their own). He goes on to claim that Trump ‚Äúinherited the mantle of speaking in public like a   barfly from the man who turned out to be the star of the Nashville show: Andrew Breitbart, founder of the eponymous   media outlet. ‚Äù Evidently Trump‚Äôs long public record has eluded Raban, who argues that Trump learned his craft from Breitbart: ‚ÄúThe   has the blunt pugnacity of the Breitbartian style. Like his tweets, his policy statements have the brutal concision of jokes. ‚Äù Raban goes on to compare Trump  ‚Äî   and, by implication, Breitbart  ‚Äî   to a Latin American dictator: ‚ÄúI once heard Jorge Luis Borges talk about how dictators relished cruel jokes as demonstrations of their power,‚Äù he says, relishing this bit of recalled armchair political philosophy as some kind of proof. In fact, in his lifetime  ‚Äî   as Trump‚Äôs many detractors were wont to point out during the election  ‚Äî   Andrew Breitbart had criticized Trump at times. (One area where Trump earned Andrew Breitbart‚Äôs praise: his ability to see through the media‚Äôs pretenses.) But again, never mind the facts. Raban describes Breitbart as a ‚Äú  bully,‚Äù exactly inverting Breitbart‚Äôs character. Andrew stood up to bullies, and relished nothing more than confronting the bullies in the mainstream media  ‚Äî   such as propagandists like Raban, who descend from upon high to pour scorn on the little people of Nashville,   their na√Øve effort at   democracy as a kind of nascent fascism, making up fake historical ‚Äúfacts‚Äù they expect no one will dare to challenge. Six years later, the little people of Nashville have finally won something, and the New York Times cannot stomach its loss. So it has attacked Breitbart News in an attempt to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù it. There is no greater accolade than to be considered the Times‚Äò greatest enemy. But one expects something more effective  ‚Äî   and more principled  ‚Äî   from such a formerly august institution. Sadly, the Times has decided to go the fascist route, urging the destruction of its most effective conservative competitor, using ‚Äúfake news‚Äù to make the case for censorship to its credulous   readership. It is an effort as illiberal as it is futile. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the ‚Äúmost influential‚Äù people in news media in 2016.

19855,"Facebook Blocks Ad Blockers, but It Strives to Make Ads More Relevant - The New York Times",Mike Isaac,"SAN FRANCISCO  ‚Ä0î   Digital ads pop up online so frequently and ubiquitously that many people are using software to block them. But if you try to stop ads from showing up on Facebook‚Äôs desktop website, you will now be out of luck: The social network has found a way to block the ad blockers. On Tuesday, Facebook flipped a switch on its desktop website that essentially renders all ad blockers  ‚Äî   the programs that prevent websites from displaying ads on the page when a user visits the site  ‚Äî   useless. The change allows the Silicon Valley company to serve ads on its desktop site even to people who have   software installed and running. ‚ÄúDisruptive ads are an industry problem, and the rise of ad blockers is a strong signal that people just don‚Äôt want to see them,‚Äù Andrew Bosworth, vice president for Facebook‚Äôs ads and business platform, said in an interview. ‚ÄúBut ad blockers are a really bad solution to that. ‚Äù Facebook‚Äôs move is set to add to a furious debate about the ethics of ad blocking. On one hand, many digital ads are a nuisance  ‚Äî   they slow loading times of web pages and detract from the online experience. Yet the ads also serve as the business foundation for many digital publishers to provide content to readers. Ad blockers have become a threat to publishers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which are facing declining advertising revenue. About 200 million people worldwide use   software on their desktop computers, according to estimates from PageFair, an     . An additional 420 million use ad blockers on their smartphones, the company said. Several digital publishers, including Wired, Forbes and The Times, have begun experimenting with    techniques, including asking visitors who use ad blockers to ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù their sites so that ads may still appear. ‚ÄúWe need to spell this out clearly to our users. The journalism they enjoy costs real money and needs to be paid for,‚Äù Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of The Times, said at an ad industry conference in June where he addressed ad blocking. ‚ÄúAdvertising is a vital part of the revenue mix. ‚Äù Mr. Bosworth of Facebook said ad blockers were ‚Äúcertainly bad for the publications who are robbed of half of the value exchange between users and publishers. ‚Äù But rather than blocking all ads, he said, Facebook needed to find a way to serve better ads. Facebook‚Äôs move is perhaps the strongest    measure taken by a major technology company, especially one that serves advertising to more than 1. 7 billion monthly users globally. The effort is risky for the company, which prides itself on delivering the best user experience, because it could alienate some people for whom ad blocking is an ideological stance on how they wish to gain access to the internet. To shut down the blockers, Facebook is taking aim at the signifiers in digital ads that blockers use to detect whether something is an ad. Facebook‚Äôs desktop sitewide changes will then make ad content indistinguishable from   content. For blockers to get around these changes, Facebook said they would have to begin analyzing the content of the ads themselves, a costly and laborious process. Still, Facebook will continue to let people have some control over the ads they do and do not see. On Tuesday, the company also introduced an overhauled version of its ad preferences tool, which lets people opt out of seeing certain types of ads on the site. That will help Facebook serve more relevant ads, rather than bombard people with ads they do not want. ‚ÄúWe want people to help us do a better job with ads, rather than to fundamentally alter the way the service is rendered,‚Äù Mr. Bosworth said. The move against ad blockers on the desktop site will not affect blockers used to access Facebook on a mobile web browser, the company said. It will also not apply to Facebook‚Äôs mobile apps, which already include advertising that cannot be blocked by outside programs. Facebook did not announce plans to expand the changes to mobile browsers in the future. Executives in the   industry denounced Facebook‚Äôs decision, calling it a misguided waste of time that would harm the social network‚Äôs members. ‚ÄúIt takes a dark path against user choice,‚Äù Ben Williams, communications and operations manager at Eyeo G. m. b. H. the company behind AdBlock Plus, wrote in a blog post after Facebook announced the change. The move also stoked the ire of those who support ad blockers because of their ability to prevent the use of tracking software, which is often employed to monitor users‚Äô browsing habits across the web without their knowledge or express consent. But the advertising industry welcomed the change. ‚ÄúFacebook should be applauded for its leadership on preserving a vibrant value exchange with its users,‚Äù Randall Rothenberg, president and chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said in a statement. ‚ÄúFor hundreds of years, advertising and marketing have been central to the delivery of entertainment and services that are otherwise free to consumers. ‚Äù For Facebook, which is a member of the I. A. B. advertising forms the core of its business. The company generated $3. 69 billion in profit on $17. 93 billion in revenue in 2015, a majority of which came from paid advertising. In its most recent quarter, Facebook said mobile ads produced 84 percent of ad revenue. One of Facebook‚Äôs biggest advertisers recently called into question the effectiveness of some of the company‚Äôs ads. On Tuesday, Procter  Gamble told The Wall Street Journal it was scaling back on hypertargeted ad campaigns on the social network. A P. G. spokeswoman said the company would not be spending less money on overall Facebook ads. ‚ÄúFacebook has a history of going out of their way to keep advertisers happy,‚Äù said Ian Schafer, founder and chief executive of Deep Focus, an ad agency. ‚ÄúThis plays into what advertisers demand in terms of accountability for publishers. ‚Äù Others said that Facebook was striking a middle ground by stopping ad blockers but still giving people some options over what ads they would see. ‚ÄúMany users rely on ad blockers because they are concerned about privacy or malware,‚Äù said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry think tank that is funded in part by tech companies, including Facebook. ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äôs change lets users continue to use ad blockers to protect themselves, while ensuring ads are displayed. ‚Äù",0

In 2005, North Korea declared itself a nuclear power. So far, it has conducted five underground nuclear tests ‚Äî in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016, raising concerns of both the neighboring states and the international community.

Pyongyang is currently under pressure from the international community since its latest nuclear test in September and a long-range rocket launch in February, which resulted in tightening sanctions against North Korea in the new UN Security Council resolution in March. ...",1
19860,Trump Puts a Presidential-Size Spotlight on His Brand - The New York Times,Eric Lipton and Noah Weiland,"WASHINGTON  ‚Ä0î   President Trump‚Äôs Saturday started with a trip to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. By Saturday night, on one of the few weekends since the inauguration that Mr. Trump remained in Washington, the president was dining at the Trump International Hotel a few blocks from the White House. He was greeted by   as he entered and exited the hotel‚Äôs steakhouse restaurant, BLT Prime by David Burke, with his daughter and   . On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump was once again at the family‚Äôs Virginia golf course. For Mr. Trump, it was just another weekend with a   spotlight on his family‚Äôs business outlets, a pattern that started during his transition when he drew international attention to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. by interviewing potential cabinet picks there. Saturday‚Äôs stops marked the eighth weekend in a row  ‚Äî   out of the 10 weekends he has been in office  ‚Äî   that Mr. Trump has visited a   property, including his    resort in Palm Beach. White House officials have said Mr. Trump goes to his clubs and restaurants because he is comfortable there, but critics increasingly argue that the visits are priceless advertising and that Mr. Trump and his family are using the presidency as a way to enrich themselves. ‚ÄúIt is normal for presidents to get out  ‚Äî   and it can be a boost for small businesses across the city and the country,‚Äù said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a liberal nonprofit group. ‚ÄúBut with President Trump, he spends his down time as a walking advertisement for his businesses. It is a major departure from historic norm and degradation of the office. ‚Äù Eric Trump, in an interview this month, disputed any suggestion that his father‚Äôs visits to family properties represented a conflict of interest. But he agreed that the Trump Organization‚Äôs assets  ‚Äî   from    where interest in memberships has surged, to its golf courses  ‚Äî   were doing well. ‚ÄúThe stars have all aligned,‚Äù said Eric Trump, during a recent news conference in Washington to promote the upcoming Senior PGA Championship tournament at the Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Va. Memorial Day weekend. (He did not mention his father by name.) As executive vice president of the Trump Organization, he oversees its 16 owned or operated golf courses around the world. ‚ÄúI think our brand is the hottest it has ever been. ‚Äù The president has now made three visits to the Trump National Golf Club. . Tickets to the event are being sold as Mr. Trump is pushing the golf course into the spotlight, with reporters and photographers in tow on Saturday for a daylong visit. On Sunday shortly after 11 a. m. with reporters placed at the complex‚Äôs indoor tennis center, Mr. Trump made a quick visit to the club for what White House officials said were three meetings. By noon Mr. Trump was headed back to Washington. Photos of Mr. Trump surfaced on social media on Saturday and Sunday that appeared to show him in golf shoes and out on the golf course on Saturday, and then sitting at the golf club, during his short visit Sunday, watching a game of golf on television. The New York Times confirmed, via   tools, that the items were posted Sunday from the Trump National Golf Club. But the White House officials did not respond when asked about the photographs, and would not confirm whether Mr. Trump played golf. The warm welcome Mr. Trump received Saturday night at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue offered a hint of why Mr. Trump may visit his family‚Äôs establishments so often: He is almost guaranteed the kind of enthusiastic crowd he would never find at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland‚Äôs Catoctin Mountains. ‚ÄúKeep up the good work!‚Äù one man shouted after Mr. Trump wrapped up his dinner at the hotel on Saturday. ‚ÄúThank you, Donald! Thank you, Trump!‚Äù another man yelled. Mr. Trump arrived shortly after 9 p. m.  ‚Äî   a reporter from The Times was already having dinner at the hotel‚Äôs only restaurant  ‚Äî   and walked through the lobby‚Äôs expansive atrium and into the restaurant, BLT Prime.   guests turned to one another in disbelief. A man shouting Mr. Trump‚Äôs name had to be quieted by hotel security. Mr. Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his    Jared Kushner, were led to the   mezzanine, which looks out onto the vast lobby. Hotel guests leaned over the railings of the upper floors to gawk at the president sitting down for a family dinner. Mr. Trump has a particular preference for steaks, well done and with ketchup, although the restaurant would not confirm what he dined on Saturday night. The meal went on for more than two hours, even as guests had stopped eating and had turned around simply to watch Mr. Trump. One diner sitting a few feet from the Trump party said the president had interrupted his meal several times to allow   to greet him. Members of the Secret Service took over a table on the first floor and ordered drinks while waiting for the president to conclude his meal. Right above them, Mr. Trump‚Äôs personal security guard, Keith Schiller, patrolled the mezzanine level while chatting and joking with guests. ‚ÄúWe ate slowly,‚Äù said John Nix, who was having dinner at BLT Prime with his wife and three children on their final night at the hotel, which he said they had found on TripAdvisor. The family was visiting Washington from Columbus, Ga. to see sights and visit colleges, and had made a reservation for the restaurant a month before. As the two hours passed, hotel guests who had been at the bar and waiting in the lobby formed a long line, hoping to meet the president as he left. Mr. Trump happily obliged. Around 11:30 p. m. he and Ms. Trump worked the crowd, which included a teenager in a red ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hat and a young girl asleep on the shoulders of her parents. Screams then gave way to dozens of people chanting ‚ÄúU. S. A.! U. S. A. !‚Äù A few minutes later, Mr. Trump disappeared into his motorcade for the short ride home.",0
19861,The Clintons‚Äô original email scandal: One million lost emails in re Monica and Filegate,Jeff Dunetz,"Print using fax at 1950's
It‚Äôs funny how Clinton scandals always seem to get covered up by a loss of emails. Hillary‚Äôs current email scandal is not the first time this has happened to her or her hubby. During Bill Clinton‚Äôs tenure in the White House, a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù (or person) turned off an automatic email archiving system causing the loss of around one million emails . The emails that just ‚Äúhappened‚Äù to disappear were the same ones Kenneth Starr was subpoenaing for the Monica Lewinsky scandal and that Congress was asking for in its investigation of ‚ÄúFilegate.‚Äù 
Also coincidentally, the lost emails were from the server that controlled the email accounts of President Clinton and other potential witnesses in the above scandal. The people who discovered the emails were missing were threatened with jail if they spoke about the loss. 
According to the House Oversight Committee report released in December 2000: 
The White House installed an Automated Records Management System (ARMS) to store all email correspondence in one central place, and make it easier to respond to document subpoenas. Due to a misconfiguration in the system, e-mail to about 500 White House officials was never recorded. E-mail was first discovered missing in January 1998, but the extent of the problem was not realized until later that year. 
Top White House officials were notified in June. Despite the fact that e-mail was being subpoenaed in a number of civil and criminal cases, including the Lewinsky affair and the Filegate scandal, the White House did not notify investigators that some of it was missing. In mid-February 2000, the ex-chief of White House computer operations, Sheryl Hall who had moved to the Treasury Dept. came forward with allegations that Clinton administration officials were involved in an e-mail cover-up. Betty Lambuth, working for a private employer under contract to the White House, charged that White House technicians had been threatened with loss of job, arrest, and jail if they revealed the problem. 
The White House later said the problem was resulted from an‚Äúunintentional ‚Äòglitch‚Äô and blamed it on ‚Äòhuman error,‚Äô attributing the problem to a ‚Äòdisconnect‚Äô between technicians and lawyers who, apparently, did not realize that the computer mistake might have an effect on the pending subpoena requests.‚Äù 
Betty Lambuth, who worked for CEXEC, a subcontractor for Northrop-Grumman that ran and maintained the White House computer system, heard about the missing emails from one of her subordinates, Robert Haas. Hass audited the White House system in June 1998 because he and other technicians discovered that automated archiving system wasn‚Äôt scanning and storing Internet email sent to the server used by the Executive Office of the President. Lambuth testified under oath, that when she informed the White House, Office of Administration counsel Mark Lindsay told her, ‚ÄùIf I or any of my team who knew about the email problem told anyone else about it we would lose our jobs, be arrested and put in jail.‚Äù 
She said Lindsay specified that she was not to tell even her private-sector boss, Steve Hawkins, who she said eventually removed her from her White House assignment when she refused to tell him about the e-mail problem. Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem ‚ÄùProject X,‚Äù [as a joking reference to the TV show ‚ÄúThe X Files‚Äù] and because of the threats, she and her staff took to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and in a nearby Starbucks when discussing the matter. 
Lambuth also told the court , a subordinate told her some of the emails deal with ‚ÄúVice President Al Gore‚Äôs involvement in campaign fund-raising controversies‚Äù and ‚Äúthe sale of Clinton Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign contributions.‚Äù The subordinate also told her the emails also contained ‚Äúinformation on the White House‚Äôs improper gathering of FBI background files of long-ago Republican appointees and the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal‚Äù 
A Northrop Grumman official, Joseph Vasta, testified that the Clinton-Gore White House intimidated the email contractor, into participating in the e-mail cover-up. ‚ÄúVasta testified that it was made apparent that Northrop Grumman could lose its $50 million contract if it didn‚Äôt play ball with the Clinton-Gore White House.‚Äù 
Not all of the White House emails were lost‚Äì just the ones on the Mail2 server. The officials served by the Mail2 server included Doris Matsui, Marsha Scott, Sidney Blumenthal, Cheryl Mills, Bruce Lindsey, Erskine Bowles, Rahm Emanuel, Nancy Hernreich, John Podesta, Ira Magaziner, Ann Lewis, Charles Ruff, Lanny Breuer, Paul Begala, and President Clinton. 
If some of those names sound familiar, they should. People such as Sid Blumenthal and Cheryl Mills have been questioned as part of the present Clinton email scandal, and John Podesta is running Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign. 
Bruce Lindsey, now the Chairman of the Board of the Clinton Foundation, was the foundation‚Äôs CEO from 2003 to 2013 during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs term as secretary of state which, according to Peter Schweizer‚Äôs best-selling book ‚ÄúClinton Cash,‚Äù was a time when the foundation and the State Department were involved in cronyism. 
As far as the historic documents and reports remaining on the web, news about ‚ÄúProject X‚Äù began to fade in October 2000 as the country approached the presidential election ‚Äì perhaps, because liberal media were trying to protect then-Vice President Al Gore as he campaigned for a promotion (which sounds like the current Clinton email case, where the lefty media are doing their best to cover up the scandal). Betty Lambuth even testified that some of the missing emails involved possible Gore campaign fund-raising controversies. 
Additionally neither the documents examined nor a subsequent internet search, turned up any mention that the Project X emails dealing with the possible Bill Clinton White House scandals have have ever been recovered and turned over to the national archives. 
From Bill Clinton‚Äôs Project X to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server scandal, losing large volumes of important emails seems to run in the family.",1
19862,Unprecedented Bond Dumping Means U.S. Dollar Collapse Ahead,Guest Post,"in: Collapse , Economy & Business , Multimedia In the following interview, Elijah Johnson and Silver Doctors bring you the latest interview with someone we haven‚Ä1ôt heard from in a while, Dr. Jim Willie. To begin the financial portion of the interview, Elijah begins by asking Dr. Willie about the unprecedented bond dumping by China and Saudi Arabia, and of course what Elijah is referring to is how several weeks ago the markets witnessed never before seen numbers when $28 billion in U.S. Treasuries were dumped one week, followed by another $23 billion a week or so later. 
Consider the massive sell-off‚Äôs just further evidence in a long line of existing examples regarding why the days of the U.S. Dollar as the World Reserve Currency are numbered. Our creditors are aware that the Fed has been engaged in non-stop printing of money out of thin air, and even though the short-term effect has been the propping up of U.S. Treasury prices, our creditors know history, something Americans seems to pay no attention to. Our creditors know that just like other countries who have engaged in the same kinds of reckless monetary policy in the past, eventually when the QE (printing money out of thin air), is removed, hyperinflation will set in, and there will be massive devaluation of the same Treasuries that were artificially propped up for so long. Most creditors expect the QE to be shut off the moment this U.S. election is over, because unlike uninformed American voters, our creditors know that In addition to his role in allowing the largest case of massive voter fraud in America history to take place on his watch, Captain Transparency in the White House has made sure his loyal servant at the Fed, Janet Yellen, has continued committing massive financial fraud at the Fed at the same time. All of these actions by the U.S. result in what Dr. Willie refers to as psychological damage not just to the full faith and credit of the United States Dollar, but to the United States itself. Creditors of U.S. debt are watching a never before seen transition in the U.S. to a system of pure corruption, undermining ANY faith they might have had in the Dollar, and giving them every reason in the world to want to distance them from the U.S. Dollar. Dr. Willie explains that any ‚Äúperceived‚Äù moral authority the U.S. once might have had is long gone. Among other things, the world learned not long ago through a shocking revelation by Wikileaks that Obama and Hillary not only knew of funds being used to provide ISIS (our enemy), with weapons during a time of war, the world has now seen that Barack Obama and Hillary allowed it. With almost a week until the official election we have heard tremendous stories of voter fraud including stories revealing as many as 20/20 examples of machines switching votes from Trump to Hillary, we know the polls have been massively rigged, and thanks to a national media as corrupt and dishonest and those they are tasked with watching over, Dr. Willie briefly mentions millennials who were recently highlighted on the Steven Colbert show expressing their excitement that Obamacare premiums are doubling in some states. The level of stupidity that is coming out of liberal indoctrination centers known as public schools or universities, where graduates have no ability to exercise critical thinking skills, is exactly why 20% college graduates are now living with their parents or grandparents, and Michael Snyder explains below. Expect that number to keep climbing considerably, particularly with a Clinton Presidency. Michael Snyder writes: In America today, more than 60 million people live in multi-generational households. That number is so large that it may seem difficult to believe, but the truth is that vast numbers of young adults have had to move back in with their parents and grandparents in recent years due to the deteriorating economy . Millions of our young people cannot find decent jobs once they leave school, and millions of them are absolutely overwhelmed by debt. Of course some of them are just lazy, but whatever the reason it is undeniable that multi-generational households are on the rise. According to the Pew Research Center , 12 percent of the U.S. population was living in multi-generational households back in 1980. Today, that number is up to 19 percent. That means nearly one out of every five U.S. adults now live with their parents or their grandparents. One of the big culprits, of course, is student loan debt.",1
19863,Kansas Rally Against Campus Carry Draws 15 People,AWR Hawkins,"Photographs show that a Wichita State University rally against campus carry drew 05 people on Tuesday, counting the speaker. [The rally was in support of proposed legislation that would undo campus carry for   citizens, forcing said citizens to wander the campus defenseless like everybody else.  According to KMUW, ‚Äúa small group‚Äù of students and staff rallied the Rhatigan Student Center. Their motto was ‚ÄúCarry Minds, Not Guns. ‚Äù Freshman Ian Englebright said campus carry ‚Äúcreates more problems than solutions. ‚Äù He said lawmakers who supported guns for   ‚Äúthink that by having concealed carry on this campus they‚Äôre making it safer, when in fact, I feel more uncomfortable because I don‚Äôt know if the person next to me has a gun or not. ‚Äù The 15 person rally at Wichita State was designed to pressure lawmakers into adopting a revision of the state‚Äôs campus carry law. That revision would allow colleges and universities to opt out of campus carry, creating a situation like we currently see in Ohio, where campus carry is legal at the state level but barred by every college and university because some students get nervous when   citizens are armed for  . For example, Ohio State University president Michael Drake is against campus carry. And even after 11 people were hospitalized following the November 28 car and knife attack attack on the Ohio State campus, Drake voiced his opposition for allowing   students to be armed to fight back. He said, ‚ÄúWe had a circumstance here where there was someone who was a threat to the community and he was neutralized by a professional within one minute and that would be how we think things should go. ‚Äù The legislative change sought in Kansas would result in numerous colleges and universities taking a similar position, mandating that students remain defenseless in the classroom and simply dial 911 then shelter in place while law enforcement responds. This is the type of plan that was followed on April 16, 2007, when 32 unarmed people were shot to death on Virginia Tech‚Äôs   campus.

Presenting and attendance million of Shias at Arbaeen, create a massive and international unity among Shias. This capacity can be useful for huge cultural action.
""Mashrigh"" and ""Tasnim"" report that different religions ever require their followers to attend in specific days in the year for solidarity and correlation between followers to identify the social stream. This kind of attendance is a good publicity of that social stream, and influences the international community.
Easter, the Christians religious day
For example Christians celebrate ""Easter"" as the most important religious day with a long history every year.
 This day is a holiday in Christian‚Äôs calendar, and followers of Jesus Christ hold various ceremonies and celebration in the church.
MORE... The 10th Day‚Äôs new campaign ‚Äì community-building and social solidarity Shia Muslims gather in DC for anti-terror rally Letting freedom ring: How Islam‚Äôs universal message continues to speak through Imam Husayn ibn Ali The Jews carnival ‚ÄúPurim‚Äù
""Purim"" is a great religious festival in Jewish religion. Jews have named the fourteenth and fifteenth day of Adar in Hebrew calendar ""Purim‚Äù, and celebrate it.
Jews hold celebration in ""Synagogue"" with reading the book ""Esther"". After ceremonies, children and youth wear the colorful clothes and masks, and launch the carnival of joy in occupied Palestine territories and Jewish cities. This ceremony is advertised extensively by the Jewish dictatorial media..
But Muslims...
About 5.5 million Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia in ""Hajj days"" and perform Hajj. But "" Pure Mohammadi Islam"" and ""Alavi education"" is not advertised and explained properly in Hajj because of the restrictive policy of Saudi regime.
Imam Reza, peace be upon him, stated: If the beauty of Islam is heard by others, they all will follow wholeheartedly the prophet's household inevitably.
""Arbaeen"", golden opportunity
Attending million of Shias in Arbaeen create a massive and international unity among Shias .
Karbala can be a ""symbol"" of unity and allegiance to Imam, that has the ""world's effects"". The start of Husseini Magnetic Attraction is in ""Arbaeen"". This is the magnetic that exists in my and your heart over the centuries.
So if we can't publish the Shia massage efficiently in Hajj, we can universalize it in Shia glorious presence in the Husseini massive rally.
In fact the Hajj pilgrimage for Imam Hussein followers is in Karbala, their try between Safa and Marvah in the "" Beyn Al-Haramain"", and their ""Ihram clothes"" is the ""mourning clothes for Aba Abd-Allah"".
Walking to shrines is topical
Imam Hassan Askari, peace be upon him, mentioned that one of the real believer's sign is walking to visit Imam Hussein in Arbaeen.
Imam Sadigh, peace be upon him, told to one of his followers: Visit Imam Hussein's shrine, and don't give it up. I asked: What is the reward for visiting him? Imam ‚Äìpbuh- stated: When you walk to visit Imam Hussein, Allah gives you a reward and removes your guilt, and raises your grade.
At the other time, Imam Sadigh said: If someone goes out of his home and walks to visit Imam Hussein's shrine, Allah gives him a reward and removes him guilt for each step to visit Aba Abd-Allah, when he reaches to shrine, Allah considers him among righteous favorites. When his rites finish, Allah registers him among success, when he is coming back an angel of God stays on him and tells: The messenger of Allah says Hello and gives tidings to you that all your faults are forgiven, start again your actions.
Walking tradition has an old history.
In a way, walking tradition for Imam Hussein in Arbaien has an old history. Walking to visit Karbala was customary at Sheikh
Ansary's time. But it was forgotten for a long time. It revives again by ""Sheikh Mirza Hussein Noori"". He walked to visit Aba Abd-Allah in 1319 (Hegira) for the last time.
Although visiting Imam Hussein s shrine was often difficult, and pilgrims were not safe and secure, but they were willing to take risks and had an audience to Imam Hussein in Arbaeen.
Islamic life style
At that time with full of great interest and knowledge, in the way ""Hussein path"" that leads to Karbala, Shias called each other just with ""Hussein visitors"" (zayer Al-Hussein), or ""Hussein server"" (khadem Ol-Hussein), that is a symbol of Islamic life style.
Pilgrims of this holy and spiritual journey have a lot of blessing and gifts from God, such as: the nice spiritual state with ""holy Sayyed Al-Shohada"" - generous dealing with pilgrims entertaining and receiving by Hussein servers- sacrificing and respecting for each other- treating elders and sayyeds kindly and considerately- visiting the Imam Hussein's holy shrine in Arbaeen.
Role and place of Imam Hussein's visitors
Visiting Aba Abd-Allah is a good evidence of esteeming and honoring the divine rituals, and display love and friendship with prophet's household, according to the Quranic verse of ""Mavaddat"".
Imam Hussein's holy shrine visitors enter into heaven before all, their guilt is disappeared, their life will be long, and God provides for them and removes their sadness and sorrow.
Of course if this old tradition that is established again after destruction of Iraqi dictator, not to be cultural pathology, it will certainly have the negative effects.
Because every phenomenon is threatened, it seems if this pilgrimage tradition becomes a primer to the cultural work, it will be more effective and blessings than today.",1

19868,15 Foods High In Folic Acid,Dr. Edward F. Group III,"in: General Health There are a number of reasons it‚Ä1ôs important to get adequate amounts of folic acid. Perhaps most importantly are cellular growth and regeneration. A recent article from the New York Times fingered folic acid as one of the most, ‚Äúluscious micronutrients‚Äù available and multiple studies suggest a lack of folic acid may lead to mental conditions such as depression. Folic acid allows the body to perform many essential functions including nucleotide biosynthesis in cells, DNA synthesis and repair, red blood cell creation, and prevention of anemia. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is well known for its application in the prevention of fetal deformities, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and several types of cancer. Fortunately, there are many foods that are naturally rich sources of folic acid. Folic Acid vs. Folate While folic acid and folate are often marketed as one and the same, their metabolic effects can be quite different. Folate is the bioavailable, natural form of vitamin B9 found in a variety of plant and animal foods. Folic acid, while readily utilized by the body, is the synthetic form of the vitamin, often found in supplements and fortified foods. The body is more adept at using folate and will regulate healthy levels by releasing excess through the urine. Foods with Folate (AKA Folic Acid Although Slightly Different) 1. Dark Leafy Greens It should come as no surprise that one of the planet‚Äôs healthiest foods is also one of the highest in folate. For an immediate boost in folic acid, consider adding more spinach, collard greens, kale, turnip greens and romaine lettuce into your daily diet. Just one large plate of these delicious leafy greens can provide you with almost all of your daily needs for folate. Spinach ‚Äî 1 cup = 263 mcg of folate (65% DV) Collard Greens ‚Äî 1 cup = 177 mcg of folate (44% DV) Turnip Greens ‚Äî 1 cup = 170 mcg of folate (42% DV) Mustard Greens ‚Äî 1 cup = 103 mcg of folate (26% DV) Romaine Lettuce ‚Äî 1 cup = 76 mcg of folate (19% DV) 2. Asparagus This woody treat is perhaps one of the most nutrient dense foods with folic acid out of the entire vegetable kingdom. Eating just one cup of boiled asparagus will give you 262 mcg of folic acid, which accounts for approximately 65% of your daily needs. Not only is asparagus a delicious snack, but it‚Äôs also full of nutrients your body craves, including Vitamin K, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Manganese. 3. Broccoli Not only is broccoli one of the best detox foods you can eat, it‚Äôs also a great source for folic acid. Just one cup of broccoli will provide you with approximately 24% of your daily folic acid needs, not to mention a whole host of other important nutrients. We recommend eating organic broccoli raw or lightly steamed. 4. Citrus Fruits Many fruits contain folic acid, but citrus fruits rank the highest. Oranges are an especially rich source of folic acid. One orange holds about 50 mcg, and a large glass of juice may contain even more. Other folate-rich fruits include papaya, grapefruit, grapes, banana, cantaloupe and strawberries. Here is a short list of fruits high in folic acid. Papaya ‚Äî One papaya = 115 mcg of folate (29% DV) Oranges ‚Äî One orange = 40 mcg of folate (10% DV) Grapefruit ‚Äî One grapefruit = 30 mcg of folate (8% DV) Strawberries ‚Äî 1 cup = 25 mcg of folate (6.5% DV) Raspberries ‚Äî 1 cup = 14 mcg of folate (4% DV) 5. Beans, Peas and Lentils Beans and peas especially high in folic acid include pinto beans, lima beans, green peas, black-eyed peas and kidney beans. A small bowl of any type of lentils will give you the majority of your recommended daily amounts of folate. Here is a short list of which beans have the most folic acid. Lentils ‚Äî 1 cup = 358 mcg of folate (90% DV) Pinto Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 294 mcg of folate (74% DV) Garbanzo Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 282 mcg of folate (71% DV) Black Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 256 mcg of folate (64% DV) Navy Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 254 mcg of folate (64% DV) Kidney Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 229 mcg of folate (57% DV) Lima Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 156 mcg of folate (39% DV) Split Peas ‚Äî 1 cup = 127 mcg of folate (32% DV) Green Peas ‚Äî 1 cup = 101 mcg of folate (25% DV) Green Beans ‚Äî 1 cup = 42 mcg of folate (10% DV) 6. Avocado The most beloved vegetable of Mexican fare, the butter pear, or avocado, holds up to 90mcg of folate per cup, which accounts for appoximately 22% of your daily needs. Not only are avocados one of the best foods with folic acid, but it‚Äôs also an excellent source of fatty acids, vitamin K and dietary fiber. Adding them to sandwiches or salads will make for an extra-healthy treat. 7. Okra The world‚Äôs slimiest veggie is also one of the most nutrient rich. Okra has the distinct ability to simultaneously offer vitamins and minerals while cleansing the entire digestive tract from toxic build-up. When it comes to folate, Okra is a great source. Just one cup of cooked okra will give you approximately 37 mcg of folic acid. 8. Brussels Sprout While brussels sprouts probably isn‚Äôt your favorite vegetable, there is no denying that they are one of the best foods for folic acid. Eating one cup of boiled brussels sprouts will give you approximately 25% of your daily recommended amount. Brussels sprouts are also high in vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin A, manganese and potassium. Even with the abundance of nutrients, it still remains incredibly difficult to convince your kid to give them a try. 9. Seeds and Nuts It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs pumpkin, sesame, sunflower or flax seeds , eating them raw, sprouted, or sprinkled onto a salad will add a healthy serving of folic acid. Sunflower seeds, flax seeds and peanuts are especially high in folate, with one cup offering up to 300 mcg. Nuts are also very high in folic acid, with both peanuts and almonds ranking especially high. Below is a short list of the best seeds and nuts for folic acid. Sunflower Seeds ‚Äî ¬º cup = 82 mcg of folate (21% DV) Peanuts ‚Äî ¬º cup = 88 mcg of folate (22%) Flax Seeds ‚Äî 2 tbs = 54 mcg of folate (14% DV) Almonds ‚Äî 1 cup = 46 mcg pf fp;ate (12% DV) 10. Cauliflower This cruciferous vegetable is typically regarded as one of the best vitamin C foods , but it‚Äôs also a great source of folic acid. Eating just one cup of cauliflower will give you approximately 55 mcg of folate, accounting for 14% of your recommended daily value. I recommend adding fresh cauliflower to a salad with some of the other folic acid foods on this list. 11. Beets Beets are a great source for antioxidants and they also provide detox support, making them one of the best liver cleanse foods on the planet. While that‚Äôs a great reason to add them to your diet, beets are also known as one of the best foods with folic acid. Eating one cup of boiled beets will provide you with approximately 136 mcg of folate, accounting for 34% of your daily needs. 12. Corn You probably have a can of corn in your pantry right now. Eat it up! This popular vegetable contains plenty of folate. Just one cup of cooked corn will give you approximately 76 mcg of folic acid, accounting for almost 20% of your daily needs. I recommend avoiding canned veggies and opting for fresh and organic. 13. Celery Celery is commonly regarded as a great food to help with kidney stones, but did you know it‚Äôs also a great source for folic acid? Just one cup of raw celery will give you approximately 34 mcg of folate, accounting for 8% of your daily needs. 14. Carrots Carrots are another extremely popular vegetable that is probably in your home right now. Just one cup of raw carrots will give you almost 5% of your daily recommended needs for folic acid. Eat baby carrots as a snack or add them to your salads for a folate boost! 15. Squash Squash may not be the most popular vegetable for your family, but there is no denying its nutritional benefits. And, if you make it right, it can be delicious. Whether it‚Äôs summer squash or winter squash, adding squash to your diet will help give you a boost in folic acid. Here is a breakdown of how much folate can be found in squash. Winter squash ‚Äî 1 cup = 57 mcg of folate (14% DV) Summer Squash ‚Äî 1 cup = 36 mcg of folate (9% DV) These are just a few of the foods with folic acid, are you aware of others?

19869,Michael Wolff on MILO‚Äôs ‚ÄôDangerous‚Äô: Publishing Is a Business - Breitbart,Breitbart Tech,"In USA Today, journalist and author Michael Wolff explained to critics of Breitbart Senior Editor MILO‚Ä0ôs upcoming book Dangerous that ‚Äúthe publishing businesses is a business,‚Äù pointing out that the publication of the book was inevitable given the profits that stood to be made. [‚ÄúThe traditional view, at least since publishing, in the late Victorian age, became a   and therefore respectable industry, is that if you publish it, you own it. You were not only legally responsible for it, but it firmly attached to your reputation,‚Äù Wolff explained. ‚ÄúThis led to protocols about editing, fact checking, and the development of a long cannon of journalism standards and ethics. It also led to the idea of publishing brands. What you published defined you in the community and in the marketplace. ‚Äù  The Yiannopoulos book is a particularly good example of the breakdown of this view. Book imprints were once the staunchest cultural gatekeepers, with issues of taste and sales closely twinned, and with the decision to publish resting, often, on a small group of editors, or even on a single shoulder. You knew who was responsible. But then a massive consolidation of the business occurred, mixing and mashing brands, and, with new financial dictates, in essence, commoditizing books. Any book that makes financial sense to publish, no matter its nature, will, practically speaking, be published by any publisher. Beyond a book‚Äôs financial bona fides, there is no real vetting, or editing, or concerns about taste. Most of the book industry is now a business focused on creating products ‚Äî  often novelty products connected to a celebrity ‚Äî  for specific market segments. A new crop of conservative publishers were suddenly making lots of money publishing conservative books. Hence, every major publisher hurried to established its own conservative imprint  ‚Äî   the Yiannopoulos book is published by Simon  Schuster‚Äôs Threshold Editions ‚Äî  often run by liberals. In a sense, this is an example of the media overcoming its bias. In another sense, it‚Äôs purely cynical: we believe none of this, but the money‚Äôs good. Read the full article at USA Today.",0
19870,Fox Sports 1‚Äôs Jason Whitlock Slams Sports Media for its Drive to the Left - Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,"Former ESPN host and Fox Sports 01 commentator Jason Whitlock slammed the sports media for its drift toward   politics, criticized former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his faux   protests, and even stuck up for Breitbart Sports. [In a new interview with Michael McCarthy of Sporting News, Whitlock pokes his finger in the eyes of presumptuous sports reporters who think they speak for African Americans, slaps around a few major sports stars, and dishes about his treatment at ESPN.  Long a lightning rod for his    views, Whitlock has a long history in sports media. He‚Äôs been a columnist for the Kansas City Star, a star commentator for ESPN, a radio talk show host, a writer for Huffington Post, the central figure of a popular sports website, and a Fox Sports contributor. He was also on the other side of the   divide, having been an offensive lineman for Ball State University‚Äôs Cardinals football program. The interview started off with Whitlock criticizing NBA star LeBron James for essentially sitting out games after partying too hard the night before, but the interview then jumped straight to Whitlock‚Äôs criticism of the leftward lurch of sports media. The topic kicked off as Whitlock slammed former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his season of clueless   protests. Even as he doubted that politics had kept Kaepernick from landing a new team as a free agent  ‚Äî   Whitlock said Kaepernick is ‚Äúdelusional about his standing in the league‚Äù  ‚Äî   the sports writer called the quarterback‚Äôs protests ill informed and muddled. ‚ÄúKap is running around with Twitter idiots who love to play the race card,‚Äù Whitlock said. ‚ÄúNo general manager or coach wants [black lives activist] Shaun King   them in the New York Daily News about a   quarterback who is trying to prove his blackness through public gestures. ‚Äù Whitlock went on to urge Kaepernick to ‚Äúget new friends,‚Äù and stop hanging around with people coddling him over his   protests. The sports firebrand also noted that he is one of the few who has the spine to point out that Kaepernick is likely dealing with a personal identity crisis due to his upbringing, too. Whitlock said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve angered the far left by pointing out that Kap has some understandable identity issues based on his unique upbringing and a society that is brutally harsh on   people. Kap is not a thought leader on race or even informed about the issues. He was a guy who liked to kick it, lift weights and be a celebrity quarterback. The Niners benched him and he became a militant activist, which made him attractive to the   movement. ‚Äù That brought the conversation to the   tilt of the media, something Whitlock has criticized. Sporting News asked Whitlock if liberals are trying to ‚Äúkill the golden goose‚Äù by corrupting sports coverage with   politics. Whitlock was adamant that liberals really are ruining sports media with political content. ‚Äú  political ideologues want to reshape sports culture to their liking,‚Äù Whitlock said. ‚ÄúSports culture has long had a major impact on American culture. The values taught and celebrated in sports are conservative. The far left wants to change that. They want sports to have a liberal impact. ‚Äù The interviewer then asked about the charges made by Breitbart Sports that ESPN is too liberal. Sporting News labeled Breitbart Sports as an ‚Äú ‚Äù site trying to stir attacks against ESPN, but Whitlock shot that down, saying, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs unfair to pin this on the ‚Äò  media.‚Äô ESPN and most of the mainstream media have lurched farther left. That‚Äôs a complaint from middle America and, in my opinion, objective America. ESPN‚Äôs own ombudsman acknowledged ESPN‚Äôs hardcore progressive slant. ‚Äù Of course, Whitlock is referring to the piece written by ESPN Ombudsman Jim Brady last year exploring whether or not the network has drifted too far to the left. But, even as he spent several thousand words reviewing the claim, Brady ended up insisting that the network had not gone too far left. Despite Brady‚Äôs pronouncement, this year ESPN issued new guidelines in an effort to put a dampener on its   talent‚Äôs penchant for spouting off on liberal political topics. Speaking of ESPN‚Äôs new   guidelines, Whitlock sees the new rules as ‚Äúconfusing. ‚Äù Before wrapping up, among the other topics in the interview, Whitlock criticized college player Lonzo Ball‚Äôs outspoken and activist father, saying the man has ‚Äúemasculated‚Äù his son with all his public shenanigans. Whitlock said LaVar Ball is ‚Äúhurting‚Äù his sons‚Äô basketball careers. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs making their careers about him rather than about them,‚Äù Whitlock continued. ‚ÄúLaVar is doing way too much. I hope he   his role. ‚Äù Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com",0

Kevin Brady at CPAC: We‚Äôre Going to End the Tax on ‚ÄôMade in America‚Äô - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"Breitbart‚Ä0ôs    Alex Marlow interviewed House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady on reforming the tax code, the proposed border adjustment tax, and abolishing the death tax. [Brady highlighted congressional Republicans‚Äô proposal to tax foreign imports and end taxes on   products.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to end the tax on ‚ÄòMade in America,‚Äô‚Äù Brady said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.  The ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù tax gained its nickname from supporters of   products because   products in the U. S. are taxed at a lower rate than products made in the U. S. Brady and House Republicans have proposed a border adjustment tax that would impose a 20 percent tax on imports and is estimated to raise over a trillion dollars in a decade. President Trump has said that the border tax could boost U. S. jobs, but Marlow wondered whether the tax will have any consequences for small businesses that rely on imports, such as job losses. Marlow said that 97 percent of importers are small business and asked Brady whether the tax would make it harder for small businesses to conduct business. Brady said that foreign products receive a lot of special tax breaks, and ‚Äúcompetition is best for consumers when everyone is taxed the same. ‚Äù Brady also advocated for a ‚Äúfairer, simpler tax code‚Äù and said Americans will soon be able to file taxes with less paperwork. ‚ÄúThe tax code will be so fair and so simple, nine out of 10 Americans will be able to file on a   system,‚Äù Brady said. Marlow brought up the topic of media bias  ‚Äî   which, as the    of Breitbart News, was his ‚Äúfavorite topic. ‚Äù He asked Brady what he thought of the current ‚Äúmedia environment‚Äù surrounding the issue of taxation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge, ‚Äù Brady said. Marlow also highlighted how taxation can be viewed as a moral issue, citing ‚Äúthe confiscation of wealth from the American people,‚Äù and asked Brady whether the issue of taxation should be considered through a ‚Äúmoral lens. ‚Äù Brady replied that it should be, citing the ‚Äúwork, innovation, and value‚Äù American workers bring to the economy. Marlow closed the interview by asking Brady what would happen to the death tax in the future. ‚ÄúFor the first time since the death tax was created in 1916, House Republicans propose to permanently kill the death tax,‚Äù Brady said.",0

Woodward On Clinton Foundation ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Corrupt‚Äù By VNN on October 28, 2016 He‚Äôs correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton‚Äôs role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Conservative Tribune 
Voters have been concerned about Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs involvement in the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation. 
Liberal journalist Bob Woodward legitimized those concerns Sunday on Fox News by pointing to the Foundation‚Äôs ‚Äú pay-for-play ‚Äù scandals while Clinton served as secretary of state as something that should trouble voters. 
Woodward, who broke the Watergate story that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon, told host Chris Wallace in no uncertain terms that the Clinton Foundation is ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù and a ‚Äúscandal.‚Äù 
Watch Woodward‚Äôs comments on Fox News Sunday here: 
‚ÄúThere are allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play,‚Äù Wallace said. ‚ÄúWhen you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new revelations (sic) about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the Foundation and the King of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this?‚Äù 
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Woodward responded. ‚Äú It‚Äôs corrupt . It‚Äôs a scandal.‚Äù 
Wallace had attempted to get answers from Clinton about the issue at the final presidential debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump. 
But of course Clinton ducked the moderator‚Äôs question and instead talked about the organization‚Äôs charitable donations rather than its extreme conflicts of interest ‚Äî something Woodward took note of and criticized her for. 
‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt answer your question at all,‚Äù Woodward told Wallace. ‚ÄúAnd she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done.‚Äù 
Woodward apparently didn‚Äôt want to discredit the ‚Äúgood work‚Äù done by the organization, but pointed out that even its ‚Äúgood work‚Äù is compromised by the overwhelming evidence of corruption. 
‚Äú(T)he mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation and actions by the State Department ‚Äî which she ran ‚Äî are all intertwined and it‚Äôs corrupt,‚Äù he argued. 
He‚Äôs correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton‚Äôs role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Unfortunately Clinton has an acute ability to avoid being held accountable for her scandals, but we have faith in the American people and their desire to be led by a person with integrity and respect for the office he holds, not someone who continuously looks for ways for his political power to benefit his personal life.

19875,"With Deflategate Ruling, Roger Goodell Is Firmly in Control - The New York Times",William C. Rhoden,"When I reached Ron Katz on Monday, the first word out of his mouth was ‚Äúvindication. ‚Ä01ù He was referring to Tom Brady. ‚ÄúThe moral issues always remain the same,‚Äù said Katz, the chairman emeritus of the Institute of Sports Law and Ethics at Santa Clara University and now a Distinguished Careers Institute Fellow at Stanford. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you can get away with,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to rise above that. ‚Äù Brady is one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play the game, and I would have him on my starting team each Sunday. But he has lost credibility that he may never regain. The Brady case  ‚Äî   his role in improperly deflated footballs  ‚Äî   seemed silly at first. But this molehill became a mountain that the N. F. L. was willing to die on to protect its shield. The case has been a winding road to the truth since January 2015, after the Patriots‚Äô lopsided victory over Indianapolis in the A. F. C. championship game. The most extraordinary evidence against Brady was the Wells report, which suggested that Brady did not always play by the rules when it came to using properly inflated footballs. Based on the report, Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Brady for four   games. The Patriots were also fined $1 million and lost a couple of draft picks, including this year‚Äôs No. 1. Brady argued that he was unfairly suspended. Last July, Brady‚Äôs suspension was upheld by Goodell. Last September, Judge Richard M. Berman said Goodell administered ‚Äúhis own brand of industrial justice‚Äú and overturned Goodell‚Äôs ruling. That decision allowed Brady to play the entire season, a season he used as a revenge tour and one that New England fans turned into a football holy war. Monday‚Äôs ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ripped apart every shred of Berman‚Äôs decision. It reaffirmed Goodell‚Äôs broad authority to administer discipline as he pleases and it affirmed his power. This is power that the N. F. L. Players Association willingly gave up during the last collective bargaining agreement. Players who challenged Goodell‚Äôs authority  ‚Äî   Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy  ‚Äî   were emboldened by what they perceived as a crack in Goodell‚Äôs armor. They challenged his authority with lawsuits. But Monday‚Äôs decision was loud and clear: Goodell has the hammer again and is willing to drop it. I am all for resisting and challenging authority. But the deflation scandal was never a noble cause. Brady was caught cheating and was uncooperative, having his phone destroyed around the time league investigators wanted access to it. ‚ÄúI would say this goes beyond power I think it‚Äôs really about order,‚Äù Katz said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a league unless somebody has the authority to make decisions. Otherwise you have disorder, you have chaos. ‚Äù It‚Äôs about order and Brady‚Äôs stature. Celebrity may have gotten Brady a favorable decision from Berman, but it was ultimately not enough to keep him from being suspended. ‚ÄùIf this case had been brought by a journeyman quarterback, he would not have gotten beyond the   line,‚Äù Katz said. He added: ‚ÄúThe only reason it got as far as it did was because it was Tom Brady. We have a   society, but when you get to court, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a celebrity. ‚Äù After two years of missteps, Goodell is on a roll. Earlier this month, a court of appeals upheld a Federal District Court judge‚Äôs decision approving the N. F. L. concussion settlement agreement. Linda S. Greene, the   law professor at the University of Wisconsin, draws a sharp distinction between how Goodell successfully handled the Brady case and how he mishandled the Ray Rice investigation, protecting a star player and his team in a clear case of domestic abuse. ‚ÄúThis is a win for the commissioner,‚Äù Greene said, ‚Äúbut unlike in the Ray Rice case, where the decision was the byproduct of a commissioner who looked the other way at Rice‚Äôs egregious conduct, the Brady suspension was the product of a thorough investigation, a lengthy hearing over which the commissioner presided. ‚Äù The union released a statement on Monday. It was disappointed by the ruling, adding that it would ‚Äúcarefully review the decision, consider all of our options and continue to fight for players‚Äô rights and for the integrity of the game. ‚Äù Katz said, ‚ÄúThey negotiated this agreement where the commissioner had this power, and that‚Äôs the way it should have proceeded. ‚Äù The union should stop the fight for Brady. Brady‚Äôs team of legal advisers should tell him to accept the decision. The court‚Äôs   decision can be appealed to the full Second Circuit Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the Supreme Court will have any interest in this whatsoever,‚Äù Katz said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done. ‚Äù Brady should take the sack and let the sport he has soiled have its vindication.",0

19878,Tuberculosis: Refugees Produce 29 Percent of Active Cases in New Hampshire - Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,"The refugees resettled by the federal government in New Hampshire produced 29 percent of all diagnosed active tuberculosis (TB) cases in the state during 2014 and 2015, says the Centers for Disease Control. [Three contagious TB cases, or ‚Äúactive tuberculosis,‚Äù in New Hampshire were diagnosed in refugees in 2015, and four cases were diagnosed in refugees during 2014. During that two year period, a total of 24 cases of active TB were diagnosed in New Hampshire.  So seven of the 24 active cases, or 29 percent, were among refugees delivered by the federal government. The refugee population is less than one percent of the total state population. New Hampshire does, however, have a much higher per capita rate of refugee TB compared to other states. Between FY 2008 and FY 2015, 4, 368 refugees were resettled in New Hampshire by the federal government. More than 80 percent of these refugees, or 3, 497 out of 4, 368, arrived from four high TB burden countries, according to the Department of State ‚Äî  Bhutan (2, 239 refugees) the Democratic Republic of Congo (797 refugees) Burma (291 refugees) and Somalia (170 refugees). Only Minnesota, where 33 percent of TB cases during this period, or 99 out of 297, were diagnosed in refugees, had a higher percentage than New Hampshire‚Äôs 29 percent among all 46 states for which the CDC reports data on immigration status upon first entry data for   cases of TB. (Arizona, Illinois, Virginia, and Washington do not report this data to the CDC.) The national average, 4. 5 percent, is significantly lower. ‚ÄúIn New Hampshire, based on our most recent 2015 data, a total of 13 cases of TB were reported to the NH Department of Health  Human Services, Division of Public Health Services (DPHS) 11 of these cases (85%) were among   persons,‚Äù a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Department of Health  Human Services told Breitbart News in an emailed statement. New Hampshire‚Äôs percentage of   cases of TB in 2015 was 19 percent higher than the national average of 66 percent. In 1986, the national average of   cases of TB was only 22 percent. ‚ÄúNH DPHS does not distinguish among categories of   because our public health interventions are not different however, based on the most recent CDC surveillance report, (table 36) only 3 of these 11   individuals diagnosed with TB in 2015 were refugees,‚Äù the spokesperson added. Only two of the 13 cases of active TB in New Hampshire in 2015 were diagnosed in U. S.  residents. Three cases were diagnosed in refugees, and six cases were diagnosed in   residents of New Hampshire whose immigration status upon initial arrival in the United States was something other than refugee. Three of these six   residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with active TB in 2015 had an immigrant visa as their immigration status at first entry into the United States, according to the CDC publication Reported Tuberculosis in the United States, 2015. One arrived on a student visa, one arrived on an employment visa, and one arrived as an  . Breitbart News asked the New Hampshire Department of Health  Human Services why such a high percentage of total TB in New Hampshire is diagnosed in refugees. ‚ÄúWhen there are as few TB patients as in New Hampshire, proportions may seem high and reporting such may be misleading,‚Äù the spokesperson responded. ‚ÄúThe total number of TB diagnoses among our refugees is very low,‚Äù the spokesperson concluded. But the pattern of high rates of active TB diagnosed among refugees in the state of New Hampshire is not a   ‚Äúblip,‚Äù or data outlier, experienced only in 2015. In 2014, for instance, four refugees resettled in New Hampshire were diagnosed with active TB out of a total of 11 cases diagnosed among New Hampshire residents, according to CDC data. Three U. S.  residents of New Hampshire were diagnosed with active TB that year, while four   residents whose initial immigration status upon arrival was something other than refugee were also diagnosed. In 2013, four out of the 15 cases of active TB diagnosed in New Hampshire, or 26 percent of all cases, were diagnosed in refugees. Ten cases were ‚Äúother  ‚Äù and one was U. S. . A stunning 93 percent of all cases of TB diagnosed that year in the state were  . In 2012, one out of 9 cases of active TB diagnosed in New Hampshire, or 11 percent of all cases, wase diagnosed in a refugee. Nine cases were ‚Äúother  ‚Äù and none were U. S. . One hundred percent of all cases of TB diagnosed that year in the state were  . Breitbart News asked the the New Hampshire Department of Health  Human Services if ‚ÄúNH DPHS does not distinguish among categories of   because our public health interventions are not different,‚Äù how then, did the CDC determine that ‚Äú3 of these 11   individuals diagnosed with TB in 2015 were refugees‚Äù if the state of New Hampshire did not provide this data on refugees to them. The New Hampshire Department of Health  Human Services has not yet responded to that inquiry. The  CDC states that data used in its annual publication Reported Tuberculosis in the United States is provided directly by the states: Reporting areas (i. e. the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC) New York City, Puerto Rico, and other U. S. jurisdictions in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea) provide information regarding tuberculosis (TB) cases to CDC‚Äôs National TB Surveillance System (NTSS) by using a standard case report form, Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis (RVCT). When asked if the state of New Hampshire has a plan to effectively deal with this refugee TB issue, the spokesperson for the New Hampshire Department of Health  Human Services did offer a response. ‚ÄúTB is an important but treatable and curable disease. NH DPHS continues to comprehensively address management of TB in accordance with national guidelines through testing for and treating of TB infections surveillance and education of healthcare providers,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThese strategies apply to all NH residents whether U. S.  or ‚Äù the spokesperson added. Incoming New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, the first Republican to hold that office in twelve years,  may want to consider establishing a new common sense TB control strategy: not resettling refugees from high TB burden countries in the state.

19879,Meet the journalist facing 45 years in jail for filming the tar sands pipeline protest in North Dakota,Natural News Editors,"Meet the journalist facing 41 years in jail for filming the tar sands pipeline protest in North Dakota 
Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: First Amendment , Dakota Pipeline , criminal journalism (NaturalNews) Are North Dakota authorities waging a war against the public's right to know about the ongoing Standing Rock pipeline protests? We are joined by documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, who was charged earlier this month with three felonies for filming an act of civil disobedience in which climate activists manually turned off the safety valves to stop the flow of tar sands oil through pipelines spanning the U.S. and Canada.The actions took place in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Washington state. Schlosberg is an award-winning filmmaker and was the producer of Josh Fox's recent documentary, ""How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change."" She was filming the action at a valve station owned by TransCanada in Walhalla, North Dakota. She was arrested along with the activists, and her footage was confiscated. Then she was charged with a Class A felony and two Class C felonies‚Äîwhich combined carry a 45-year maximum sentence.(Article republished from DemocracyNow.org ) TRANSCRIPT AMY GOODMAN: But we're joined right now in Los Angeles by Democracy Now! video stream by Deia Schlosberg, the award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, who was arrested on October 11th in a different area of North Dakota, while reporting on a climate change protest in Walhalla, North Dakota, charged with three felonies, facing 45 years in prison, if convicted. Also with us, Josh Fox. His article in The Nation, ""The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline is a Threat to Democracy‚Äîand the Planet."" His previous documentaries include Gasland, which first exposed the harms of the fracking industry, nominated for an Academy Award, also made Gasland 2, which aired on HBO.We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Deia, describe what happened to you. DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Well, on October 11th, I was working as a climate reporter, as I've done for years and years and years, as Josh and I were doing, and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team, when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand, people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So, there were‚Äîthere were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site, outside of Walhalla, as you said. I was‚ÄîI was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it's essential for journalists to‚Äîjournalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there's a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. AMY GOODMAN: So when did the police come? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: The police came after‚Äîwell, the activist that was doing the action, Michael, had called the company ahead of time to say that he was‚Äîhe was going to shut off the valve, so they could‚Äîto give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile, the company notified the local police. So, after the valve was closed, they came in probably about 15 minutes. I had my camera set up on a tripod on the public road. And they told me I was arrested for being an accessory to a crime, at which point I was brought to the local jail . I figured it would‚Äîthings would just have to clear up once they realized what was‚Äî AMY GOODMAN: So, they charged you with three felonies? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: ‚Äîthat I was just, you know, exercising my First Amendment‚Äî AMY GOODMAN: What were the felonies? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Conspiracy‚Äîthey were all conspiracy charges: conspiracy to theft of public‚Äîtheft of property, conspiracy to theft of service and conspiracy of interfering with a public‚Äîa critical public infrastructure. AMY GOODMAN: And you face 45 years in jail? What is your comment on this? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: What is my what? Sorry, the connection is‚Äî AMY GOODMAN: What do say about this? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: It's absolutely outrageous. Yeah, I mean, this is what I‚Äîthis is what I do for my living. This is what I've done for years and years. There's absolutely no grounds for these charges.Read more at: DemocracyNow.org",1

19881,Internet Porn Nearly Ruined His Life. Now He Wants to Help. - The New York Times,Sridhar Pappu,"Alexander Rhodes sat along a stretch of grass, looking out over the Allegheny River. The two of us were sitting in a quiet space on the outskirts of P0ttsburgh where we had planned to spend the night in tents camping out. ‚ÄúThe key thing to consider is that I am not a very good businessman,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really anything but a guy who was addicted to internet porn. ‚Äù A few years ago, Mr. Rhodes, 26, founded a website as an online space meant to help others who share his particular problem. It has about one million unique visitors each month, he said, and nearly breaks even. Mr. Rhodes, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and worked at Google until recently, is now hoping to make his site into something larger. With the help of his father and other family members, he is transforming part of an abandoned church into a base of operations for his fledgling company. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to look back and regret what happened in terms of growing up, being addicted to internet porn,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou might look back and be like: ‚ÄòOh, man. I was a loser. And if I never watched it, my life would be so much better.‚Äô And maybe that‚Äôs true. But at the same time, the fact that I was addicted to internet porn, the fact that I was so mediocre, makes me uniquely qualified to help humanity. ‚Äù In recent years, Mr. Rhodes has emerged as a spokesman against a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù that hasn‚Äôt been officially recognized by the medical establishment. He seemed uneasy with his new status. He was careful with every word and asked to go off the record more than a government official. He would not confirm whether he was involved with someone, saying only that, since giving up pornography ‚Äúfor good‚Äù in 2013, he has been able to have meaningful relationships with women. In some ways, his story is that of the digital age. His father was a computer programmer, and he was exposed to digital technology from early on. He gravitated to Nintendo Game Boy and eventually moved to the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation. At 11 or so, he said, he clicked on a banner ad by mistake and found an image depicting rape. By the time he had reached adolescence, so had the internet, and Mr. Rhodes came to rely on   pornography that was easy to find and often free. By college, he was masturbating while watching it up to 14 times a day, he said. ‚ÄúI would say, ‚ÄòO. K. I have to take a few days to recover from this, like physically recover,‚Äô‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I couldn‚Äôt last for even a day. ‚Äù Mr. Rhodes‚Äôs seeming dependence on porn didn‚Äôt help matters with his first girlfriend, whom he started dating when he was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. It was his first real chance for sustained intimacy, and he blew it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was all due to internet porn,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I can tell you that the sex life didn‚Äôt go very well. I had   erectile dysfunction  ‚Äî   a very mild form, and this is all very   because doctors won‚Äôt diagnose this  ‚Äî   but I was able to maintain an erection by fantasizing about pornography. That was the only way. ‚Äù In 2011, Mr. Rhodes was lost and in search of support. He created a discussion forum on Reddit on the topic of abstaining from masturbation and pornography. He realized he was far from alone and began his   site soon after. After college, he continued to build the site while working as a contractor for Google, specializing in data analysis. He said he earned good money and was able to put a good amount into the website (called NoFap. com, from a slang term for masturbation). But he was still using the supposed vice he was railing against. It took another failed relationship to get him to quit. ‚ÄúI think I was relying on pornography as some kind of emotional crutch,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf anything bad would happen, you would go to porn, because it would always be there. ‚ÄúI knew it was bad for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I also realized it was bad for women I was involved with, and that was the moment that I said: ‚ÄòI need to leave this thing behind. It is completely distorting my sexuality to the point where it could actually be harmful or at least not enjoyable for other people who I am involved with. ‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Rhodes came to believe he had a calling greater than his work in data analysis at Google. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt an easy decision,‚Äù he said of his leaving the job last year. ‚ÄúBut ultimately it was what was best for humanity. ‚Äù The website serves as an online umbrella for men looking to escape pornography. It has advertisements for   software and online programs that promote the idea of steering clear of pornography and masturbation. The site also has discussion forums and includes testimonials by men sharing stories of their successes and failures. And it helps match men with ‚Äúaccountability partners‚Äù meant to serve as Alcoholics   sponsors, to keep a person on the right path. The site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertising, Mr. Rhodes said. To make it into something more robust, Mr. Rhodes needed to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù as a spokesman of sorts. After he appeared in a New York magazine article in 2013 about men who had quit masturbating, he told his mother what was going on, much to her horror. Other interviews followed. While his family remains supportive, there are limits. When he showed his mother a recent article in Time magazine in which he was quoted, she said, joking, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be reading these types of things about my son,‚Äù Mr. Rhodes said, recalling his mother‚Äôs reaction. On the first day I visited Mr. Rhodes, we climbed the stairs of the former St. Clement Church in Tarentum, Pa. The structure, built in 1906, had long since been abandoned, its pews, confessional and attached school crumbling and gathering dust. His father, Phillip Rhodes, had recently bought the sprawling complex at auction for $50, 000. While the church is likely to house other businesses, the younger Mr. Rhodes sees a future there for him and a fully staffed operation. He sat on one side of the church confessional while I sat on the other. ‚ÄúTell me the last time you watched porn,‚Äù I said, joking. Despite the location, he has largely kept away from religious people, especially evangelicals wanting to team up with him, even though such a relationship could help fund his work. ‚ÄúI have viewpoints that don‚Äôt mesh with their viewpoints,‚Äù Mr. Rhodes said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very  . I‚Äôm not a religious person. I‚Äôm not someone who supports religion. I‚Äôm not against religion, but I don‚Äôt support it. And I completely, firmly believe in premarital sex. ‚Äù Mr. Rhodes said he has also endured the wrath of those on the other end of the ideological spectrum. People have tried  ‚Äî   and failed  ‚Äî   to hack the site‚Äôs servers, and its forums have been bombarded with pornographic images, he said. His father received pornography in the mail, Mr. Rhodes said, and he himself has gotten death threats. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just something you have to deal with and let the proper authorities follow up on anything,‚Äù he said. Soon it would grow terribly cold, making for a terrible night of sleep in spite of a tent and a supposedly insulated sleeping bag that I bought at a suburban Target. On the morning of our second day, Mr. Rhodes sat near the extinguished campfire from the night before, laptop on his knees. Soon we‚Äôd be departing the campsite, heading back to the city, to ‚Äúcivilization. ‚Äù But first he had to present a webinar for another   outfit. During the chat, he spoke with people who asked about avoiding triggers. As the session continued, he spoke less about pornography than about the need to take care of oneself, both physically and emotionally. He talked about developing good habits and routines, about changing one‚Äôs life in general. When a health care worker asked about fatigue and how he believed it often led him to pornography, Mr. Rhodes told the man that he needed to take care of his own health as well. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like if you‚Äôre on an airplane flight,‚Äù Mr. Rhodes said, ‚Äúand they say, ‚ÄòOh, you have to put your oxygen mask on before assisting others with theirs.‚Äô It‚Äôs because you‚Äôll pass out trying to get a mask on to somebody else. You have to make sure you‚Äôre in a balanced spot in order to best serve other people, in order to best serve the world. ‚Äù",0
19882,"Magnetic storm could disrupt power grids, navigation systems and satellites over the next few days",Editor,"This magnetic storm could disrupt power grids, radio navigation systems and satellites causing problems with phone and internet networks A  1 giant coronal hole in the sun recently sent charged particles hurtling toward Earth.
These solar winds triggered a geomagnetic storm that could disrupt power grids, radio navigation systems and satellites, which could cause problems with phone and internet networks.

This most recent event was big enough for the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center to issue a moderate geomagnetic storm watch for Wednesday.

It isn‚Äôt all bad news, though. Because of the strength of the storm, parts of the United States may get a look at the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights.

Areas as far south as northern Indiana and northern Ohio could get a bit of a show overnight.
Over the next few days, the chances of any disruptions and auroras will decrease.

19883,Donald Trump‚Äôs Victory Promises to Upend the International Order - The New York Times,Peter Baker,"JERUSALEM  ‚Äî   Donald J. Trump‚Ä0ôs stunning election victory on Tuesday night rippled way beyond the nation‚Äôs boundaries, upending an international order that prevailed for decades and raising profound questions about America‚Äôs place in the world. For the first time since before World War II, Americans chose a president who promised to reverse the internationalism practiced by predecessors of both parties and to build walls both physical and metaphorical. Mr. Trump‚Äôs win foreshadowed an America more focused on its own affairs while leaving the world to take care of itself. The outsider revolution that propelled him to power over the Washington establishment of both political parties also reflected a fundamental shift in international politics evidenced already this year by events like Britain‚Äôs referendum vote to leave the European Union. Mr. Trump‚Äôs success could fuel the populist, nativist, nationalist,   movements already so evident in Europe and spreading to other parts of the world. Global markets fell after Tuesday‚Äôs election and many around the world scrambled to figure out what it might mean in parochial terms. For Mexico, it seemed to presage a new era of confrontation with its northern neighbor. For Europe and Asia, it could rewrite the rules of modern alliances, trade deals, and foreign aid. For the Middle East, it foreshadowed a possible alignment with Russia and fresh conflict with Iran. ‚ÄúAll bets are off,‚Äù said Agust√≠n Barrios G√≥mez, a former congressman in Mexico and president of the Mexico Image Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting its reputation abroad. Crispin Blunt, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Britain‚Äôs House of Commons, said, ‚ÄúWe are plunged into uncertainty and the unknown. ‚Äù Many linked Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory to the British vote to exit the European Union and saw a broader unraveling of the modern international system. ‚ÄúAfter Brexit and this election, everything is now possible,‚Äù G√©rard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States, wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúA world is collapsing before our eyes. ‚Äù The election enthralled people around the world on Tuesday night: night owls watching television in a youth hostel in Tel Aviv computer technicians monitoring results on their laptops in Hong Kong and even onetime oil pipeline terrorists in Nigeria‚Äôs remote Delta creeks, who expressed concern about how Mr. Trump‚Äôs election would affect their country. It is hardly surprising that much of the world was rooting for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump, who characterized his foreign policy as ‚ÄúAmerica First. ‚Äù He promised to build a wall along the Mexican border and temporarily bar Muslim immigrants from entering the United States. He questioned Washington‚Äôs longstanding commitment to NATO allies, called for cutting foreign aid, praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, vowed to rip up international trade deals, assailed China and suggested Asian allies develop nuclear weapons. Polls indicated that Mrs. Clinton was favored in many countries, with the exception of Russia. Last summer, the Pew Research Center found that people in all 15 countries it surveyed trusted Mrs. Clinton to do the right thing in foreign affairs more than Mr. Trump by ratios as high as 10 to one. Mr. Trump‚Äôs promise to pull back militarily and economically left many overseas contemplating a road ahead without an American ally. ‚ÄúThe question is whether you will continue to be involved in international affairs as a dependable ally to your friends and allies,‚Äù said Kunihiko Miyake, a former Japanese diplomat now teaching at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. ‚ÄúIf you stop doing that, then all the European, Middle Eastern and Asian allies to the United States will reconsider how they secure themselves. ‚Äù In Germany, where American troops have been stationed for more than seven decades, the prospect of a pullback seemed bewildering. ‚ÄúIt would be the end of an era,‚Äù Henrik M√ºller, a journalism professor at the Technical University of Dortmund, wrote in Der Spiegel. ‚ÄúThe postwar era in which Americans‚Äô atomic weapons and its military presence in Europe shielded first the west and later the central European states would be over. Europe would have to take care of its own security. ‚Äù Norbert R√∂ttgen, chairman of the German parliamentary committee for foreign policy and a member of the ruling party, said Mr. Trump was ‚Äúcompletely inadequate‚Äù to his office. ‚ÄúThat Trump‚Äôs election could lead to the worst estrangement between America and Europe since the Vietnam War would be the least of the damage,‚Äù he said. Perhaps nowhere was Mr. Trump‚Äôs win more alarming than in Mexico, which has objected to his promises to build a wall and bill America‚Äôs southern neighbor for it. ‚ÄúI see a clear and present danger,‚Äù said Rossana   director of the Mexico Media Lab, a think tank, and a founder of the Latin American edition of Foreign Affairs. ‚ÄúEvery moment will be a challenge. Every move or declaration will be something that will not make us comfortable in the neighborhood  ‚Äî   and that is to everyone‚Äôs detriment. ‚Äù With about $531 billion in trade in goods last year, Mexico is America‚Äôs   partner after Canada and China. Supply chains in both countries are interdependent, with American goods and parts shipped to Mexican factories to build products that are shipped back into the United States for sale. Five million American jobs directly depend on trade with Mexico, according to the Mexico Institute. The Mexican peso immediately fell 13 percent after the election, its biggest drop in decades. Mr. Barrios G√≥mez, the former congressman, predicted a   peso devaluation of 20 percent and a Mexican recession ‚Äúas supply chains across the continent become sclerotic and investments dry up. ‚Äù The business community, he said, was ‚Äúfreaking out. ‚Äù The economic fallout will probably reverberate farther. Izumi Kobayashi, vice chairwoman of Keizai Doyukai, a Japanese business group, predicted a drop in foreign investment in the United States as executives skeptical of Mr. Trump wait to see what he does. ‚ÄúHe has been focusing on the negative side of the global markets and globalization,‚Äù Ms. Kobayashi said. ‚ÄúBut at the same time it is really difficult to go back to the old business world. So how will he explain to the people that benefit and also the fact that there is no option to go back to the old model of business?‚Äù The uneasiness with Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory overseas ranged far beyond the country‚Äôs traditional partners. Abubakar Kari, a   professor at the University of Abuja, said most Nigerians believed a Trump administration would not bother with issues outside the United States. ‚ÄúIf Trump wins, God forbid,‚Äù Macharia Gaitho, one of Kenya‚Äôs most popular columnists, wrote on Tuesday before the votes came in, ‚Äúthen we will have to reassess our relations with the United States. ‚Äù One of the few places where Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory was greeted enthusiastically was Russia, where   television has been feasting on the circuslike elements of the American election. Not since the Cold War has Russia played such a big role in a presidential election, with Mr. Trump praising Mr. Putin and American investigators concluding that Russians had hacked Democratic email messages. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs presidency will make the U. S. sink into a   crisis, including an economic one,‚Äù said Vladimir Frolov, a Russian columnist and international affairs analyst. ‚ÄúThe U. S. will be occupied with its own issues and will not bother Putin with questions. ‚Äù ‚ÄúAs a consequence,‚Äù he added, ‚ÄúMoscow will have a window of opportunity in geopolitical terms. For instance, it can claim control over the former Soviet Union and a part of the Middle East. What is there not to like?‚Äù Others tried to find the upside. Mr. Blunt, the British lawmaker, said he was heartened by Mr. Trump‚Äôs selection of Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate and thought that Britain might be the exception to the new president‚Äôs hostility toward trade deals. Israel was another place where Mr. Trump enjoyed some support, mainly because of the perception that he would give the country a freer hand in its handling of the longstanding conflict with the Palestinians. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders and commentators worried about a broader disengagement from a Middle East awash in war, terrorism and upheaval. ‚ÄúDecisions cannot be postponed,‚Äù said Yohanan Plesner, a former member of the Israeli Parliament now serving as president of the Israel Democracy Institute. ‚ÄúThe situation in Syria is very chaotic. The unrest in the region is continuing. America has to decide whether it wants to play an active role in shaping the developments of the region. ‚Äù And even some countries that might expect to see some benefits from an American retreat worried about the implications. Counterintuitive as it might seem, China was concerned about Mr. Trump‚Äôs promise to pull American troops back from Asia. ‚ÄúIf he indeed withdraws the troops from Japan, the Japanese may develop their own nuclear weapons,‚Äù said Shen Dingli, professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai. ‚ÄúSouth Korea may also go nuclear if Trump cancels the missile deployment and leaves the country alone facing the North‚Äôs threats. How is that good for China?‚Äù For American voters, that was not the point. After decades of worrying about what was good for other countries, they decided it was time to worry about what was good for America. And Mr. Trump promised to do just that, even if the rest of the world might not like it.",0
19884,"Google Party Over? Alphabet Cracks Down on Costs, Layoffs Ensue, Division CEOs Quit",IWB,"Google Party Over? Alphabet Cracks Down on Costs, Layoffs Ensue, Division CEOs Quit by IWB ¬∑ October 17, 2016 
Wolf Richter wolfstreet.com , www.amazon.com/author/wolfrichter 
Third CEO of an Alphabet division to leave since June. 
Five years ago, when Google announced that it would build a super-high-speed fiber-optic network in Kansas City, and then roll it out in other cities, it started an effort to own and control the data pipelines going into homes and businesses. 
Given how frustrated consumers are with their ISPs, it seems people couldn‚Äôt wait for Google Fiber, now operated by Alphabet‚Äôs Access. Google then spent a fortune building out the network in select cities around the country. This could have been huge . At a huge cost. 
‚ÄúAmazing bet,‚Äù is what Craig Barratt, senior VP at Alphabet and CEO of Access, called Google Fiber in a blogpost yesterday. In the same breath, he also announced that they would ‚Äúpause‚Äù the build-out of Google Fiber in cities where it had been planned, that there would be layoffs and reassignments, though he didn‚Äôt say how many, and that he‚Äôd ‚Äústep aside‚Äù as CEO of Access. 
His replacement has not been announced. 
He‚Äôs the third CEO of an Alphabet division to part ways since June. He prefaced this whole debacle this way: 
And thanks to the hard work of everyone on the Access team, our business is solid: our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly, and we expect that growth to continue. I am extremely proud of what we‚Äôve built together in five short years. 
Google Fiber is one of two big entities in ‚ÄúOther Bets‚Äù of the Alphabet empire, whose CEO Larry Page and new-ish CFO Ruth Porat are trying to crack down on ballooning costs. 
The other big entity in ‚ÄúOther Bets‚Äù is Nest Labs, which makes internet-connected thermostats and the like. In a brilliant move, Google had acquired it in 2014 for a breath-taking $3.2 billion. But by now, this move has become very unbrilliant. 
In June, Tony Fadell, Nest co-founder and CEO, quit after internal disputes over this focus on spending. Some key Nest employees moved to Google‚Äôs new hardware division. And the entity is in turmoil. 
In August, Bill Maris, CEO of Google‚Äôs venture capital arm, GV, also left. 
Earlier this year, Alphabet got second thoughts about its ambitious robotics efforts and put Boston Dynamics up for sale. It had acquired the experimental robot maker in 2013 for $500 million. But tensions soon arose, and co-founder Andy Rubin bailed out in 2014. No deal yet. 
Then there was, infamously, Google Glass‚Ä¶. 
So Google Fiber is in good company. It will cease efforts to install a fiber network in 10 cities where it had been planned but not fully committed, according to Ars Technica . In addition, San Francisco was supposed to get Google fiber for sure, but that has now been cancelled too. 
The 11 cities where Google Fiber has been nixed: Chicago, Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Tampa. 
In ‚Äúthis handful of cities‚Äù and also ‚Äúin certain related areas of our supporting operations, we‚Äôll be reducing our employee base,‚Äù Barratt wrote. Hence the layoffs. 
Google Fiber has already been rolled out in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Kansas City (Missouri and Kansas), Nashville, Provo (Utah), Salt Lake City, and The Triangle (North Carolina). And it‚Äôs still publicly committed to building the network ‚Äì subject to change, I suppose ‚Äì in Huntsville (Alabama), Irvine (California), San Antonio, and Louisville. 
In June, Google Fiber announced that it would acquire Webpass, a 13-year-old company that provides high-speed wireless internet in Boston, Chicago, Miami, San Diego, Oakland, and San Francisco. A wireless network is a lot cheaper to install in urban areas with multi-family housing than fiber-to-the-home. 
About 9% of the employees at Access will lose their jobs, though some people could be reassigned to entities of Alphabet, according to Ars Technica: 
The source did not say exactly how many employees that percentage represents. Access includes more than just Google Fiber, so the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned is probably a little higher. 
Alphabet headcounts are hard to come by, but this Bloomberg report says Access has about 1,500 employees. The Information report indicates that Google Fiber had about 1,000 employees before the layoffs. If both of those numbers are accurate, then the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned to other parts of Alphabet might be around 13.5 percent. 
Google Fiber apparently has not hit its subscriber goals, and fiber construction is a costly endeavor. While the company isn‚Äôt giving up on fiber entirely, it may be able to deploy Internet service at a lower cost using wireless technology. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs billions of dollars a year just to maintain this stuff, and Google doesn‚Äôt want to spend that kind of money on just being another player in that market,‚Äù Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, told Bloomberg . 
‚ÄúI think the new CFO put an end to the experiment that wasn‚Äôt really going anywhere,‚Äù Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless industry analyst, told Bloomberg . 
So serving up digital ads is still Alphabet‚Äôs main business, and flourishing. Controlling the high-speed pipeline to get these ads into homes and businesses, and grabbing whatever data can be grabbed by ISPs via deep-packet inspection and other methods still seems to be part of the plan, but now through cheaper and less glamorous wireless services and no longer through the holy grail of data pipelines, optical fiber. And so goes another huge dream to diversity away from advertising.",1

The words of John Trudell, who walked on late last year, ring out in this video by filmmakers Heather Rae, Cody Lucich and Ben Dupris, who recently spent time with the water protectors near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation who are trying to stop the Dakota Access oil pipeline‚Äôs proposed route under the Missouri River. His words, delivered in the 1980 speech We Are Power , are even more prophetic in the wake of the destruction of sacred burial grounds and the use of dogs and pepper spray against those who tried to stop it. 
‚ÄúThe brutality of the American corporate state way of life is nothing more than violence and repression, and it has nothing to do with power,‚Äù Trudell‚Äôs voice says. ‚ÄúIt is brutality. It‚Äôs a lack of a sane balance.‚Äù 
Rae, who produced and directed the 2005 Sundance Film Festival documentary selection Trudell , teamed up with Lucich and Dupris and posted this on the Sundance Institute‚Äôs website. They graciously shared this, their footage of the movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline, with Indian Country Today Media Network . [watch video below]",1

19887,The Inherent Violence of Israel‚Äôs Gaza Blockade,Mike Merryman-Lotze,"Photo by Swithun Crowe | CC BY 1.0 
This fall, the U.S. agreed to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next ten years, ensuring America‚Äôs continued role in funding the occupation of Palestine. Meanwhile, my friends and colleagues here in Gaza live in fear of another significant Israeli attack in the near future. 
They have every reason to fear another major escalation ‚Äî violence is a daily reality in Gaza. In two recent incidents, a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel without causing damage or injuries, and in both instances Israel responded by bombing targets throughout Gaza. 
In August alone, Israel bombed more than 50 locations in the small territory . 
The simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction: Palestinians attacked Israel with a rocket and Israel responded. We hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort, but it‚Äôs woefully incomplete. 
In both instances, the rockets fired weren‚Äôt fired by Hamas, but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with Hamas, which governs Gaza. These groups seek to incite Israeli attacks on Hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over Gaza, because they see Hamas as too comfortable with the status quo. 
Since seizing power in 2007, Hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory. Outside of periods of defined military escalation ‚Äî which tend to be precipitated by Israeli attacks ‚Äî they have effectively stopped attacks against Israel from Gaza. 
This explains why, as noted by the Israeli press, there were only 14 rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel between January and August this year. None were fired by Hamas, so Israel‚Äôs decision to target Hamas as a response makes no sense. 
Of course, 14 rockets fired from Gaza is 14 too many for those of us committed to ending all violence, and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by Hamas. 
But, as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories reports , there were also 45 Israeli military incursions into Gaza this year, resulting in 7 Palestinian deaths and, on average, injuring five Palestinians in Gaza every week. 
This is the part of the story that isn‚Äôt told. 
Gaza also remains under an Israeli-imposed blockade that severely limits travel, trade, and life for Gazans. Despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the 2014 Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement, the blockade remains in effect. 
Israel, with support from the U.S. government, claims this decades-long blockade is in place to pressure the people of Gaza to rise up against Hamas and provide security for Israelis. 
If those are Israel‚Äôs raisons d‚Äôetre, then it‚Äôs a complete failure. It hasn‚Äôt stopped violence, it hasn‚Äôt weakened Hamas, and it hasn‚Äôt brought Israelis or Palestinians security. 
While the blockade hasn‚Äôt succeeded in achieving the changes Israel claims to be seeking, its impact on the civilian population of Gaza has been immense. 
Over two years after the end of the last large military operation there, much of Gaza remains in ruins. 
Of the 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza who were displaced during the 2014 Israeli bombardment, over 65,000 remain homeless, as 70 percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed haven‚Äôt been rebuilt. This is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering Gaza. 
This important context is too often missing as U.S. pundits and politicians consider the situation in Gaza. 
Given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by Israel, the firing of less than 2 rockets per month by Palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence. 
If the U.S. is serious about promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, preventing future violence in Gaza, and guaranteeing security, then it must recognize the violence inherent in the Israeli occupation and end the blockade. 
The next attack on Gaza, feared by my friends who live there, is an inevitable reality if nothing changes. 
Mike Merryman-Lotze has worked with the American Friends Service Committee as the Palestine-Israel Program Director since 2010.

19888,"94 Psychiatric Patients in South Africa Died of Negligence, Report Finds - The New York Times",Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura,"Corpses of psychiatric patients were found with head injuries and unexplained bruises. Relatives were not inf0rmed of the deaths of their loved ones. The transfers of mentally ill patients were seen as business opportunities. Those were some of the findings of a South African government investigation published on Wednesday that determined that 94 psychiatric patients died of negligence last year after being moved by the authorities in Gauteng Province to facilities that were likened in some cases to concentration camps. The report prompted calls for criminal prosecutions. More than 1, 300 patients under state care were transferred last year from a unit of Life Healthcare Group, a private hospital group in South Africa, to 27 charitable organizations in an effort by the health department in the province to save money. Pretoria, the country‚Äôs administrative capital, and Johannesburg are in Gauteng. The investigation was opened last September after 36 patients were found dead after being moved to some of the facilities operated by the charitable organizations. The report, by Professor Malegapuru W. Makgoba, the South African health ombudsman, found that the death toll was nearly 100, however. Investigators found facilities that were overcrowded and ‚Äúfull of hungry patients,‚Äù adding that some were wearing pants held together with shoelaces. Other patients complained of rotten food and said they went weeks without medication. The decision to move the patients ‚Äúwas unwise and flawed,‚Äù the report said, ‚Äúwith inadequate planning and a chaotic and rushed or hurried implementation process. ‚Äù All 27 of the organizations operated under invalid licenses, it said, so patients who were transferred there had died in ‚Äúunlawful circumstances. ‚Äù The authorities in Gauteng Province, along with some of the care centers, could not be reached for comment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs remarkable that only one person has died from a mental   illness,‚Äù Professor Makgoba told local new outlets on Wednesday. The others died from ‚Äúthings like dehydration, diarrhea, epilepsy, heart attacks, all other things except mental illness. ‚Äù None of the care centers had professional doctors, nurses, psychiatrists or other therapists that normally cared for the patients, Professor Makgoba said in a separate interview on Thursday. ‚ÄúYou have state patients in licensed institutions and you put them into unlicensed institutions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was shocked. ‚Äù The families of patients, as well as activists and psychiatrists, had vigorously opposed the plan to move the patients, arguing that it was dangerous to send them to facilities that were not equipped to handle them. Christopher Archer, of the South African Society of Psychiatrists, one of the groups that opposed the transfers, said that it was clear that ‚Äúprecipitous action had been taken without proper planning and these patients were moved prematurely before the facilities were property vetted. ‚Äù Public health services in South Africa are under enormous strain and severe budgetary constraints, Mr. Archer said in an interview. ‚ÄúThere are more patients than there is money and this was considered a move to try to restrain public spending,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it turns out it was completely inappropriate. ‚Äù The head of the provincial government‚Äôs health department, Qedani Mahlangu, resigned on Tuesday, just before the report was published, and there were mounting calls for David Makhura, the premier of Gauteng Province, to do the same. President Jacob Zuma thanked Professor Makgoba for his report, noting that it would help the government ‚Äúensure that such a tragedy does not recur in the health sector,‚Äù according to The Associated Press, but many South Africans said they were unconvinced. If 94 mental patients had died from official negligence in a ‚Äúnormal democracy,‚Äù the entire national government would have been forced to resign, Barney Mthombothi, a former editor of Financial Mail, a South African business publication, wrote on Twitter.",0

19891,Training French soldiers to supervise Daesh,Pete Kimberley,"Training French soldiers to supervise Daesh Voltaire Network | 17 October 2016 fran√ßais Espa√±ol italiano Deutsch T√ºrk√ße On 22 September 2016, while cleaning around an abandoned troglodyte refuge not far from the church of Saint-Florent on the outskirts of Saumur (France), a group of workers saw three men drive away hurriedly in a white van. Entering the cave, they discovered video equipment and a generator, as well as newspapers in the Arab language and Daesh flags.
Wishing to calm not only the anxiety of the population, but also the police, the gendarmerie and the sub-prefect, General Arnaud Nicolazo de Barmon, commanding officer of the Military Schools in Saumur declared that the men were not terrorists, but students of a training exercise by the Inter-Army Centre for Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Radiological defence (CIA NBCR).
If such were the case, in the middle of the current state of emergency, the CIA NBCR would have violated the rules of notification for this exercise, which should have been transmitted to the different local authorities before the exercise began. Apart from this, it is not easy to discern how any of the equipment discovered might be in any way useful for exercises in nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical defence.
In the same buildings as the CIA NBCR in Saumur are the schools specialised in Intelligence and Inter-Army Combat.
The presence of French forces has been noted since the very beginning of the events in Syria, in 2011. In 2012, 19 French soldiers who had been taken prisoner were handed back, at the Lebanese border, to the Army Chief of Staff, Admiral √âdouard Guillaud, with other soldiers supervising Baba Amr‚Äôs Islamic Emirate. The death of French soldiers supervising the Islamist troops was certified in several places, particularly in Sannayeh in 2013. While France, in 2014, had supported Al-Qa√Øda against Daesh, the presence of French officers within the Caliphate itself has been attested by several witnesses in 2016.
In November 2014, the Pentagon declared that it had killed an agent of the DGSE (Direction G√©n√©rale de la S√©curit√© Ext√©rieure) in Samarda ‚Äì the agent, David Drugeon, was working within Al-Qa√Øda, while the French Minister for Defence denied any link with the victim. Thereafter, the US Press confirmed that David Drugeon had trained Mohamed Mera (terrorist attacks in Toulouse and Montauban), and the Kouachi brothers (attack on Charlie Hebdo ).
France has never officially recognised that it has troops on the ground in Syria, although it has admitted that it shares common headquarters there with allied special forces .

19893,"In Tribute to Son, Khizr Khan Offered Citizenship Lesson at Convention - The New York Times",Richard A. Oppel Jr.,"When Capt. Humayun Khan was ordered to Iraq a d0zen years ago, his father wanted to talk to him about being an American Muslim soldier sent to war in a Muslim country. His son, though, was focused only on the job at hand. ‚ÄúI asked him, ‚ÄòHow do you feel about the whole Iraq deal?‚Äô ‚Äù recalled Khizr Khan, who became a United States citizen after emigrating from Pakistan in 1980. ‚ÄúHe said: ‚ÄòLook, that‚Äôs not my concern and that‚Äôs not my pay grade. My responsibility is to make sure my unit is safe.‚Äô And that‚Äôs all he would talk about, and nothing else. ‚Äù Captain Khan, 27, died on June 8, 2004, after he told his men to take cover and then tried to stop a suicide bomber outside the gates of his base in Baquba. And on Thursday night, speaking about his son at the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Khan gave a voice to Muslim Americans outraged by the   pronouncements of the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump. In a speech that electrified the convention and turned Mr. Khan into a social media and cable news sensation, he waved a pocket Constitution and challenged Mr. Trump, ‚ÄúYou have sacrificed nothing and no one. ‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs call for restrictions on Muslims entering the country is acutely personal, Mr. Khan said, in an interview on Friday, adding that he had no plans to campaign for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, nor had the campaign asked him to. Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Khan‚Äôs remarks. In December Mr. Trump called for ‚Äúa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country‚Äôs representatives can figure out what is going on. ‚Äù More recently, he has pledged to suspend immigration from any country ‚Äúcompromised by terrorism. ‚Äù If restrictions on Muslim immigration had been in place decades ago, Mr. Khan said, neither he, a lawyer with an advanced degree from Harvard Law School his wife, Ghazala, who taught Persian at a Pakistani college before raising three boys in the Washington suburbs their eldest son, Shaharyar, who was a top student at the University of Virginia and a   of a biotechnology company nor Captain Khan, who posthumously earned the Bronze Star, along with a Purple Heart, for saving the lives of his men, would have been allowed to settle here. A third son, Omer, who works at his brother‚Äôs biotech company, was born in the United States. ‚ÄúIf it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America,‚Äù Mr. Khan exclaimed about his deceased son during his speech, his wife by his side. Mr. Khan said that Mr. Trump ‚Äúwants to build walls and ban us from this country. ‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me ask you: Have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,‚Äù Mr. Khan said, addressing Mr. Trump directly, while pulling a miniature version of the country‚Äôs founding document from his coat pocket. Mr. Khan said he admires both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, though Thomas Jefferson is his real hero. Mr. Khan‚Äôs odyssey from lawyer and legal consultant to   D. N. C. speaker began in December, when he got a phone call from a writer for Vocativ, an online publication, who wanted his thoughts on Mr. Trump‚Äôs statements about Muslims. Mr. Khan criticized Mr. Trump‚Äôs statements as   in an article published by Vocativ. A few weeks later, he got a phone call from a Clinton campaign official, who had seen the article and asked if his comments could be used in a tribute for his son at the convention. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòWhat a wonderful honor,‚Äô ‚Äù he recalled in the interview. ‚ÄúWho am I to say, ‚ÄòNo‚Äô?‚Äù Months later, the campaign asked if he and his wife would come to the convention. ‚ÄúThe initial plan was just to go there and stand and talk to the media afterwards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen somebody called and said, ‚ÄòWould you like to say a word or two?‚Äô ‚Äù Time was tight and the schedule packed, he was told. The campaign asked whether he needed speechwriting help or any coaching. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI really don‚Äôt, I have my thoughts in my head,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt make it an hourlong speech, just let me say what I want to say. It will be   . ‚Äù Nothing from the speech, he said, was the product of the campaign, including his dig at Mr. Trump‚Äôs lack of military service. It all flowed pretty easily, because he had been thinking about these things for quite a while, he said. Mr. Khan expressed great faith in the Constitution and in a political process that bolsters a belief that ‚Äúan unqualified person will never get to this office. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI respect the Republican Party as much as the Democratic Party,‚Äù he said. But he added: ‚ÄúI definitely will continue to raise my voice out of concern that the Republican leadership must pay attention to what is taking place. ‚Äù Mr. Khan met his wife at Punjab University in Lahore, Pakistan. They moved to Dubai, where their two eldest sons were born, then arrived in Houston, renting a $   apartment. Eventually they settled outside Washington, where Mr. Khan worked at a mortgage company and law firms. Captain Khan attended John F. Kennedy High School in Silver Spring, Md. In his free time, he taught disabled children to swim. At the University of Virginia, he joined the R. O. T. C. program, and majored in psychology, his father said. He planned to attend law school. His last conversation with his parents was on Mother‚Äôs Day 2004. His mother said: ‚Äú ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want you to be a hero. I want you to return back to me safely,‚Äô ‚Äù Mr. Khan recalled. ‚ÄúOf course I will,‚Äù he promised her. ‚ÄúBut Mother, you should know I have responsibility for these soldiers, and I cannot leave them unprotected. ‚Äù The bomber who took Captain Khan‚Äôs life drove an    taxi toward the base. Had the captain not warned his men to take cover, ‚Äúthere would have been more casualties,‚Äù his brigade commander, Dana Pittard, said in an interview. Recalling the captain‚Äôs potential as he watched Mr. Khan‚Äôs speech, Mr. Pittard said, ‚ÄúI had to leave the room, it brought back such a flood of memories. ‚Äù After their son‚Äôs death, Mr. Khan and his wife, who had moved to Charlottesville to be close to their other sons, had the university‚Äôs R. O. T. C. cadets over for dinner once a year. Mr. Khan would give them each a   copy of the Constitution, just like the one he brandished on Thursday, said Tim Leroux, who used to run the R. O. T. C. program. University officials let Mr. Khan read an application essay his son wrote for a residential college. In the essay, Captain Khan wrote of how ‚Äúliberty requires vigilance and sacrifice‚Äù and that those who are ‚Äúbeneficiaries of liberty must always bear this in mind, and keep it safe from attacks. ‚Äù ‚ÄúThat summed up his later life,‚Äù Mr. Khan said.",0
19894,"Cohn: Trump Becoming ""Smarter,‚Äô ‚ÄôMore Knowledgeable‚Äô on Climate Change - Breitbart",Joel B. Pollak,"White House economic advisor Gary Cohn made the curious comment in Sicily on Friday that President Donald Trump‚Ä0ôs views on climate change were ‚Äúevolving. ‚Äù[It was not clear exactly what that meant. ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù could mean moving towards the alarmist consensus of the left  ‚Äî   or it could also mean toward a skeptical view, one more carefully informed by scientific and economic reality.  In political terms, ‚Äúevolving‚Äù is usually a term used by the left, a euphemism to describe when a politician has changed his or her position. Its most significant use was in regards to President Barack Obama‚Äôs views on gay marriage, which were said to have ‚Äúevolved‚Äù from outright Christian opposition to   liberal embrace. Like the term ‚Äúprogressive,‚Äù the term ‚Äúevolution‚Äù implies an improvement in moral and intellectual terms, from prejudice and ignorance to reason and enlightenment. The left, presuming that its own views are superior, and that the ‚Äúlong arc of history‚Äù bends in its direction, expects people to ‚Äúevolve‚Äù in its direction. What was stranger were Cohn‚Äôs words explaining how Trump is said to be evolving. The president, he said, was becoming ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and becoming ‚Äúmore knowledgeable‚Äù about the issue. Again, that could mean Trump is growing skeptical of the alarmist,   view around which our public debate on climate change revolves. (In obtaining a degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard, for instance, I became more knowledgeable about the problems in modeling climate  ‚Äî   problems that have not improved much since then, despite the radical advances in computer technology and data analysis.) It is also possible that Cohn was shaping his assessment of the president‚Äôs views to flatter his largely European audience, which believes in climate change the way people on other continents believe in religion. That flattery may have been appropriate, for diplomatic reasons. What defies explanation is why he would imply that his boss had previously been less ‚Äúsmart‚Äù about the issue, or less well informed. It is the kind of comment that tends to reinforce the false narrative the media spins about every single Republican president  ‚Äî   i. e. that he is stupid. It is also a comment that carries considerable political risk. Conservatives resent being told, usually by leftists, that their generally skeptical views on climate change are poorly informed, or ‚Äúdenialist. ‚Äù Often, the leftists making such accusations cannot actually explain themselves how climate change is presumed to take place, and never consider a view other than their own. For now, conservatives continue to hold out hope that the president ‚Äúevolves‚Äù the U. S. out of the Paris climate agreement and toward a more sensible policy that uses innovation in energy technology to harness domestic resources of all kinds, and grow the U. S. economy while reducing emissions. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the ‚Äúmost influential‚Äù people in news media in 2016.

19895,SpaceX Says It‚Äôs Ready to Launch Rockets Again - The New York Times,Kenneth Chang,"After the explosion in September of one of its rockets, SpaceX is n0w ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space, the company announced on Monday, with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday. In a statement, SpaceX  ‚Äî   or more formally, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  ‚Äî   said that an investigation had determined the likely cause: an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum. The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong, and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence. The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning, because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations  ‚Äî   the fueling of propellants  ‚Äî   about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.) The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the   rocket, and in less than a tenth of a second, that section was in flames, followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook, which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa. Under current federal laws, investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket, not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites. With few obvious clues to the explosion, the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage, that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor‚Äôs building nearby. ‚ÄúThe accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis,‚Äù SpaceX said in its statement. The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the   liquid oxygen tank. The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank. In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser, which improves engine thrust. But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool, they shrink at different rates, opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition, the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes, and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid. ‚ÄúReally surprising problem that‚Äôs never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,‚Äù Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said in an interview on CNBC in November. Both carbon and aluminum can burn, and with oxygen sandwiched in between, all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition, the company said. Tests at SpaceX‚Äôs facilities in Hawthorne, Calif. and McGregor, Tex. supported that conclusion, the company said. The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted, and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer, SpaceX said. The next SpaceX launch is to carry a   of satellites for Iridium Communications, which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites, each about the size of a Mini Cooper car. A month ago, Iridium issued a statement saying it hoped that SpaceX would be able to launch its satellites in   but less than a week later, SpaceX said it was pushing back the launch date to early January. The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. For launches from Florida, SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. SpaceX is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station this month.",0
